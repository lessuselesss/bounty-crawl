For example during my [boat project](https://discuss.px4.io/t/rc-speed-boat-with-px4-episode-1-using-px4-to-control-the-boat/28429#things-that-are-still-ambiguous-to-me-22) build, I wasn't sure if I needed to set the priority of magnetometer manually or not.\r\n\r\nThis is also quite related to the calibration pain addressed in the issue #19459. What can we do to improve user experience for setting up the sensors? If so, which part should be addressed and how?\r\n\r\nWhat could be great (in my opinion) could be something like this in QGC (it won't be a literal text output like this, but just for giving some idea):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # First mag sensor\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # One for the second mag\r\n<baro-type> |              | <baro-priority> | <baro-protocol>\r\n<gyro-type> | <gyro-orientation> | <gyro-priority> | <gyro-protocol>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I am also not sure what others expectation / needs are, so any feedback would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n## Describe your preferred solution\r\n* @davids5 pointed out that transferring device tree information over to QGC could be a solution. Could you elaborate on that?\r\n* @dagar pointed out that having a unified view in general would be good. Could you let me know if a view I suggested above is similar to what you have imagined?\r\n",

              "body": "## Describe problem solved by the proposed feature\r\nCurrently it is hard to figure out which sensors are connected where, with which configuration and which priority (e.g. `CAL_MAG0_PRIO`) in a single view. For example during my [boat project](https://discuss.px4.io/t/rc-speed-boat-with-px4-episode-1-using-px4-to-control-the-boat/28429#things-that-are-still-ambiguous-to-me-22) build, I wasn't sure if I needed to set the priority of magnetometer manually or not.\r\n\r\nThis is also quite related to the calibration pain addressed in the issue #19459. What can we do to improve user experience for setting up the sensors? If so, which part should be addressed and how?\r\n\r\nWhat could be great (in my opinion) could be something like this in QGC (it won't be a literal text output like this, but just for giving some idea):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # First mag sensor\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # One for the second mag\r\n<baro-type> |              | <baro-priority> | <baro-protocol>\r\n<gyro-type> | <gyro-orientation> | <gyro-priority> | <gyro-protocol>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I am also not sure what others expectation / needs are, so any feedback would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n## Describe your preferred solution\r\n* @davids5 pointed out that transferring device tree information over to QGC could be a solution. Could you elaborate on that?\r\n* @dagar pointed out that having a unified view in general would be good. Could you let me know if a view I suggested above is similar to what you have imagined?\r\n",
