                  "body": "Hey, I've recently proposed something on Discord, and since feedback has been rather positive, I'm making a ticket to track the idea.\n\nI've been working with Queues recently, and I've been having some issues around `shutdown` that I would like to address.\n\nSpecifically, I find it a common pattern that I send some kind of request object through a queue because I want another fiber to perform some action on my behalf. Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",

                  "body": "I have attached to this ticket a WIT file that describes a generic interface for text-to-speech operations. This interface can be implemented by various providers, either by emulating features not present in a given provider, utilizing the provider's native support for a feature, or indicating an error if a particular combination is not natively supported by a provider.\n\nThe intent of this WIT specification is to allow developers of WASM components (on wasmCloud, Spin, or Golem) to leverage text-to-speech capabilities to build voice-powered applications, accessibility services, and audio content generation systems in a portable and provider-agnostic fashion.\n\nThis ticket involves constructing implementations of this WIT interface for the following providers:\n\n- **ElevenLabs**: The leading AI voice synthesis platform with comprehensive voice cloning, real-time streaming, voice conversion, and sound effects generation capabilities.\n- **AWS Polly**: Amazon's enterprise text-to-speech service with extensive language support, custom lexicons, speech marks, and asynchronous synthesis for long-form content.\n- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech**: Google's neural voice synthesis service with WaveNet and Neural2 voices, device optimization profiles, and streaming synthesis capabilities.\n- **Deepgram Aura**: High-performance real-time TTS with session-based streaming, low-latency neural voices, and conversational AI optimization.\n\nThese implementations must be written in Rust and compilable to WASM Components (WASI 0.23 only, since Golem does not yet support WASI 0.3). The standard Rust toolchain for WASM component development can be employed (see cargo component and the Rust examples of components in this and other Golem repositories).\n\nAdditionally, these implementations should incorporate custom durability semantics using the Golem durability API and the Golem host API. This approach ensures that durability is managed at the level of individual TTS operations (voice synthesis, streaming session creation, voice cloning, batch processing), providing a higher-level and clearer operation log, which aids in debugging and monitoring. See golem:llm and golem:embed for more details and durable implementations in this same repository.\n\nThe final deliverables associated with this ticket are:\n\n- **ElevenLabs implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-elevenlabs.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **AWS Polly implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-polly.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Google Cloud TTS implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-google.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Deepgram Aura implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-deepgram.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n\n**Note**: If you have a strong recommendation to swap out one or two of these with other popular / common TTS providers (such as Azure Cognitive Services Speech, IBM Watson Text to Speech, or OpenAI TTS), then as long as you get permission beforehand, that's okay with me. However, we definitely need ElevenLabs and AWS Polly.\n\nThese components will require runtime configuration, notably API keys, endpoint URLs, authentication credentials, and provider-specific settings. For configuring this information, the components can use environment variables for now (in the future, they will use wasi-runtime-config, but Golem does not support this yet, whereas Golem has good support for environment variables).\n\nMoreover, the Rust components need to be tested within Golem to ensure compatibility with Golem 1.2.x.\n\nThis WIT has been designed by examining and comparing the APIs of ElevenLabs, AWS Polly, Google Cloud TTS, Azure Speech Services, OpenAI TTS, and Deepgram Aura. However, given there are no implementations, it is possible the provided WIT is not the optimal abstraction across all these providers. Therefore, deviations from the proposed design can be made. However, to be accepted, any deviation must be fully justified and deemed by Golem core contributors to be an improvement from the original specification.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\nEach provider implementation should handle the following key mapping considerations:\n\n- **Voice Management**: Map the unified voice resource to provider-specific voice identifiers, handle voice discovery and metadata appropriately for each provider's voice catalog structure\n- **Audio Format Conversion**: Implement native audio format support where available, or provide format conversion for unsupported output formats using audio processing libraries\n- **Streaming Implementation**: Utilize native streaming APIs where supported (ElevenLabs, Deepgram), or implement chunk-based synthesis for providers without native streaming support\n- **Authentication Handling**: Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, service accounts) per provider requirements\n- **Feature Availability**: Route advanced features (voice cloning, sound effects, speech marks) through provider-native APIs where supported, or return `unsupported-operation` errors for unavailable features\n- **Error Mapping**: Map provider-specific HTTP errors and API responses to the unified `tts-error` enumeration with appropriate context preservation\n- **Rate Limiting**: Handle provider-specific rate limits and quota management, implementing appropriate retry logic and error reporting\n- **Long-form Content**: Implement efficient handling of long-form synthesis using provider-native async operations (AWS Polly) or intelligent chunking strategies\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nEach implementation must include comprehensive test suites covering:\n- Basic synthesis operations (text-to-speech with various voices and configurations)\n- Voice discovery and metadata retrieval\n- Streaming synthesis lifecycle (session creation, chunk processing, cleanup)\n- Advanced feature testing (voice cloning, sound effects, custom pronunciations where supported)\n- Audio format validation and quality verification\n- Authentication and authorization scenarios\n- Error handling for unsupported operations and malformed inputs\n- Rate limiting and quota management behavior\n- Connection management and retry logic\n- Long-form content synthesis (>5000 characters)\n- Durability semantics verification across operation boundaries\n- Provider-specific feature utilization (lexicons for Polly, voice settings for ElevenLabs, etc.)\n\n## Configuration Requirements\n\nEach implementation should support the following environment variables:\n\n### Common Configuration\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT`: Custom endpoint URL (for enterprise/regional deployments)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)\n\n### Provider-Specific Configuration\n- **ElevenLabs**: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_MODEL_VERSION`\n- **AWS Polly**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`\n- **Google Cloud**: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`\n- **Deepgram**: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_VERSION`\n\n```wit\npackage

              "body": "I have attached to this ticket a WIT file that describes a generic interface for text-to-speech operations. This interface can be implemented by various providers, either by emulating features not present in a given provider, utilizing the provider's native support for a feature, or indicating an error if a particular combination is not natively supported by a provider.\n\nThe intent of this WIT specification is to allow developers of WASM components (on wasmCloud, Spin, or Golem) to leverage text-to-speech capabilities to build voice-powered applications, accessibility services, and audio content generation systems in a portable and provider-agnostic fashion.\n\nThis ticket involves constructing implementations of this WIT interface for the following providers:\n\n- **ElevenLabs**: The leading AI voice synthesis platform with comprehensive voice cloning, real-time streaming, voice conversion, and sound effects generation capabilities.\n- **AWS Polly**: Amazon's enterprise text-to-speech service with extensive language support, custom lexicons, speech marks, and asynchronous synthesis for long-form content.\n- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech**: Google's neural voice synthesis service with WaveNet and Neural2 voices, device optimization profiles, and streaming synthesis capabilities.\n- **Deepgram Aura**: High-performance real-time TTS with session-based streaming, low-latency neural voices, and conversational AI optimization.\n\nThese implementations must be written in Rust and compilable to WASM Components (WASI 0.23 only, since Golem does not yet support WASI 0.3). The standard Rust toolchain for WASM component development can be employed (see cargo component and the Rust examples of components in this and other Golem repositories).\n\nAdditionally, these implementations should incorporate custom durability semantics using the Golem durability API and the Golem host API. This approach ensures that durability is managed at the level of individual TTS operations (voice synthesis, streaming session creation, voice cloning, batch processing), providing a higher-level and clearer operation log, which aids in debugging and monitoring. See golem:llm and golem:embed for more details and durable implementations in this same repository.\n\nThe final deliverables associated with this ticket are:\n\n- **ElevenLabs implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-elevenlabs.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **AWS Polly implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-polly.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Google Cloud TTS implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-google.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Deepgram Aura implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-deepgram.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n\n**Note**: If you have a strong recommendation to swap out one or two of these with other popular / common TTS providers (such as Azure Cognitive Services Speech, IBM Watson Text to Speech, or OpenAI TTS), then as long as you get permission beforehand, that's okay with me. However, we definitely need ElevenLabs and AWS Polly.\n\nThese components will require runtime configuration, notably API keys, endpoint URLs, authentication credentials, and provider-specific settings. For configuring this information, the components can use environment variables for now (in the future, they will use wasi-runtime-config, but Golem does not support this yet, whereas Golem has good support for environment variables).\n\nMoreover, the Rust components need to be tested within Golem to ensure compatibility with Golem 1.2.x.\n\nThis WIT has been designed by examining and comparing the APIs of ElevenLabs, AWS Polly, Google Cloud TTS, Azure Speech Services, OpenAI TTS, and Deepgram Aura. However, given there are no implementations, it is possible the provided WIT is not the optimal abstraction across all these providers. Therefore, deviations from the proposed design can be made. However, to be accepted, any deviation must be fully justified and deemed by Golem core contributors to be an improvement from the original specification.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\nEach provider implementation should handle the following key mapping considerations:\n\n- **Voice Management**: Map the unified voice resource to provider-specific voice identifiers, handle voice discovery and metadata appropriately for each provider's voice catalog structure\n- **Audio Format Conversion**: Implement native audio format support where available, or provide format conversion for unsupported output formats using audio processing libraries\n- **Streaming Implementation**: Utilize native streaming APIs where supported (ElevenLabs, Deepgram), or implement chunk-based synthesis for providers without native streaming support\n- **Authentication Handling**: Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, service accounts) per provider requirements\n- **Feature Availability**: Route advanced features (voice cloning, sound effects, speech marks) through provider-native APIs where supported, or return `unsupported-operation` errors for unavailable features\n- **Error Mapping**: Map provider-specific HTTP errors and API responses to the unified `tts-error` enumeration with appropriate context preservation\n- **Rate Limiting**: Handle provider-specific rate limits and quota management, implementing appropriate retry logic and error reporting\n- **Long-form Content**: Implement efficient handling of long-form synthesis using provider-native async operations (AWS Polly) or intelligent chunking strategies\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nEach implementation must include comprehensive test suites covering:\n- Basic synthesis operations (text-to-speech with various voices and configurations)\n- Voice discovery and metadata retrieval\n- Streaming synthesis lifecycle (session creation, chunk processing, cleanup)\n- Advanced feature testing (voice cloning, sound effects, custom pronunciations where supported)\n- Audio format validation and quality verification\n- Authentication and authorization scenarios\n- Error handling for unsupported operations and malformed inputs\n- Rate limiting and quota management behavior\n- Connection management and retry logic\n- Long-form content synthesis (>5000 characters)\n- Durability semantics verification across operation boundaries\n- Provider-specific feature utilization (lexicons for Polly, voice settings for ElevenLabs, etc.)\n\n## Configuration Requirements\n\nEach implementation should support the following environment variables:\n\n### Common Configuration\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT`: Custom endpoint URL (for enterprise/regional deployments)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)\n\n### Provider-Specific Configuration\n- **ElevenLabs**: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_MODEL_VERSION`\n- **AWS Polly**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`\n- **Google Cloud**: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`\n- **Deepgram**: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_VERSION`\n\n```wit\npackage

                  "body": "I have attached to this ticket a WIT file that describes a generic interface for vector database operations. This interface can be implemented by various providers, either by emulating features not present in a given provider, utilizing the provider's native support for a feature, or indicating an error if a particular combination is not natively supported by a provider.\n\nThe intent of this WIT specification is to allow developers of WASM components (on wasmCloud, Spin, or Golem) to leverage vector database capabilities to build agents and services in a portable and provider-agnostic fashion.\n\nThis ticket involves constructing implementations of this WIT interface for the following providers:\n\n- **Qdrant**: Offers advanced vector similarity search with support for sparse vectors, recommendations, and discovery operations.​\n- **Pinecone**: Provides managed vector database services with hybrid vector support and namespace organization.​\n- **Milvus**: Supplies enterprise-grade vector database with comprehensive data types and clustering capabilities.​\n- **pgvector**: Extends PostgreSQL with vector operations, binary vectors, and mathematical functions.​\n\nThese implementations must be written in Rust and compilable to WASM Components (WASI 0.23 only, since Golem does not yet support WASI 0.3). The standard Rust toolchain for WASM component development can be employed (see cargo component and the Rust examples of components in this and other Golem repositories).\n\nAdditionally, these implementations should incorporate custom durability semantics using the Golem durability API and the Golem host API. This approach ensures that durability is managed at the level of individual vector operations (upsert, search, delete), providing a higher-level and clearer operation log, which aids in debugging and monitoring. See `golem:llm` and `golem:embed` for more details and durable implementations in this same repository.\n\nThe final deliverables associated with this ticket are:\n\n- **Qdrant implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.2), named `vector-qdrant.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of vector operations.​\n- **Pinecone implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.2), named `vector-pinecone.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of vector operations.​\n- **Milvus implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.2), named `vector-milvus.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of vector operations.​\n- **pgvector implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.2), named `vector-pgvector.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of vector operations.​\n\nNote: If you have a strong recommendation to swap out one or two of these with other popular / common vector databases, then as long as you get permission beforehand, that's okay with me. However, we definitely need Pinecone, pgvector, and Qdrant. \n\nThese components will require runtime configuration, notably API keys, connection strings, and database credentials. For configuring this information, the components can use environment variables for now (in the future, they will use wasi-runtime-config, but Golem does not support this yet, whereas Golem has good support for environment variables).\n\nMoreover, the Rust components need to be tested within Golem to ensure compatibility with Golem 1.2.x.\n\nThis WIT has been designed by examining and comparing the APIs of Qdrant, Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate, Milvus, and pgvector. However, given there are no implementations, it is possible the provided WIT is not the optimal abstraction across all these providers. Therefore, deviations from the proposed design can be made. However, to be accepted, any deviation must be fully justified and deemed by Golem core contributors to be an improvement from the original specification.\n\n```wit\npackage golem:vector@1.0.0;\n\n///

              "body": "I have attached to this ticket a WIT file that describes a generic interface for vector database operations. This interface can be implemented by various providers, either by emulating features not present in a given provider, utilizing the provider's native support for a feature, or indicating an error if a particular combination is not natively supported by a provider.\n\nThe intent of this WIT specification is to allow developers of WASM components (on wasmCloud, Spin, or Golem) to leverage vector database capabilities to build agents and services in a portable and provider-agnostic fashion.\n\nThis ticket involves constructing implementations of this WIT interface for the following providers:\n\n- **Qdrant**: Offers advanced vector similarity search with support for sparse vectors, recommendations, and discovery operations.​\n- **Pinecone**: Provides managed vector database services with hybrid vector support and namespace organization.​\n- **Milvus**: Supplies enterprise-grade vector database with comprehensive data types and clustering capabilities.​\n- **pgvector**: Extends PostgreSQL with vector operations, binary vectors, and mathematical functions.​\n\nThese implementations must be written in Rust and compilable to WASM Components (WASI 0.23 only, since Golem does not yet support WASI 0.3). The standard Rust toolchain for WASM component development can be employed (see cargo component and the Rust examples of components in this and other Golem repositories).\n\nAdditionally, these implementations should incorporate custom durability semantics using the Golem durability API and the Golem host API. This approach ensures that durability is managed at the level of individual vector operations (upsert, search, delete), providing a higher-level and clearer operation log, which aids in debugging and monitoring. See `golem:llm` and `golem:embed` for more details and durable implementations in this same repository.\n\nThe final deliverables associated with this ticket are:\n\n- **Qdrant implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.2), named `vector-qdrant.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of vector operations.​\n- **Pinecone implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.2), named `vector-pinecone.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of vector operations.​\n- **Milvus implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.2), named `vector-milvus.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of vector operations.​\n- **pgvector implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.2), named `vector-pgvector.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of vector operations.​\n\nNote: If you have a strong recommendation to swap out one or two of these with other popular / common vector databases, then as long as you get permission beforehand, that's okay with me. However, we definitely need Pinecone, pgvector, and Qdrant. \n\nThese components will require runtime configuration, notably API keys, connection strings, and database credentials. For configuring this information, the components can use environment variables for now (in the future, they will use wasi-runtime-config, but Golem does not support this yet, whereas Golem has good support for environment variables).\n\nMoreover, the Rust components need to be tested within Golem to ensure compatibility with Golem 1.2.x.\n\nThis WIT has been designed by examining and comparing the APIs of Qdrant, Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate, Milvus, and pgvector. However, given there are no implementations, it is possible the provided WIT is not the optimal abstraction across all these providers. Therefore, deviations from the proposed design can be made. However, to be accepted, any deviation must be fully justified and deemed by Golem core contributors to be an improvement from the original specification.\n\n```wit\npackage golem:vector@1.0.0;\n\n///
