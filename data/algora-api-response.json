                  "body": "I have attached to this ticket a WIT file that describes a generic interface for text-to-speech operations. This interface can be implemented by various providers, either by emulating features not present in a given provider, utilizing the provider's native support for a feature, or indicating an error if a particular combination is not natively supported by a provider.\n\nThe intent of this WIT specification is to allow developers of WASM components (on wasmCloud, Spin, or Golem) to leverage text-to-speech capabilities to build voice-powered applications, accessibility services, and audio content generation systems in a portable and provider-agnostic fashion.\n\nThis ticket involves constructing implementations of this WIT interface for the following providers:\n\n- **ElevenLabs**: The leading AI voice synthesis platform with comprehensive voice cloning, real-time streaming, voice conversion, and sound effects generation capabilities.\n- **AWS Polly**: Amazon's enterprise text-to-speech service with extensive language support, custom lexicons, speech marks, and asynchronous synthesis for long-form content.\n- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech**: Google's neural voice synthesis service with WaveNet and Neural2 voices, device optimization profiles, and streaming synthesis capabilities.\n- **Deepgram Aura**: High-performance real-time TTS with session-based streaming, low-latency neural voices, and conversational AI optimization.\n\nThese implementations must be written in Rust and compilable to WASM Components (WASI 0.23 only, since Golem does not yet support WASI 0.3). The standard Rust toolchain for WASM component development can be employed (see cargo component and the Rust examples of components in this and other Golem repositories).\n\nAdditionally, these implementations should incorporate custom durability semantics using the Golem durability API and the Golem host API. This approach ensures that durability is managed at the level of individual TTS operations (voice synthesis, streaming session creation, voice cloning, batch processing), providing a higher-level and clearer operation log, which aids in debugging and monitoring. See golem:llm and golem:embed for more details and durable implementations in this same repository.\n\nThe final deliverables associated with this ticket are:\n\n- **ElevenLabs implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-elevenlabs.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **AWS Polly implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-polly.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Google Cloud TTS implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-google.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Deepgram Aura implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-deepgram.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n\n**Note**: If you have a strong recommendation to swap out one or two of these with other popular / common TTS providers (such as Azure Cognitive Services Speech, IBM Watson Text to Speech, or OpenAI TTS), then as long as you get permission beforehand, that's okay with me. However, we definitely need ElevenLabs and AWS Polly.\n\nThese components will require runtime configuration, notably API keys, endpoint URLs, authentication credentials, and provider-specific settings. For configuring this information, the components can use environment variables for now (in the future, they will use wasi-runtime-config, but Golem does not support this yet, whereas Golem has good support for environment variables).\n\nMoreover, the Rust components need to be tested within Golem to ensure compatibility with Golem 1.2.x.\n\nThis WIT has been designed by examining and comparing the APIs of ElevenLabs, AWS Polly, Google Cloud TTS, Azure Speech Services, OpenAI TTS, and Deepgram Aura. However, given there are no implementations, it is possible the provided WIT is not the optimal abstraction across all these providers. Therefore, deviations from the proposed design can be made. However, to be accepted, any deviation must be fully justified and deemed by Golem core contributors to be an improvement from the original specification.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\nEach provider implementation should handle the following key mapping considerations:\n\n- **Voice Management**: Map the unified voice resource to provider-specific voice identifiers, handle voice discovery and metadata appropriately for each provider's voice catalog structure\n- **Audio Format Conversion**: Implement native audio format support where available, or provide format conversion for unsupported output formats using audio processing libraries\n- **Streaming Implementation**: Utilize native streaming APIs where supported (ElevenLabs, Deepgram), or implement chunk-based synthesis for providers without native streaming support\n- **Authentication Handling**: Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, service accounts) per provider requirements\n- **Feature Availability**: Route advanced features (voice cloning, sound effects, speech marks) through provider-native APIs where supported, or return `unsupported-operation` errors for unavailable features\n- **Error Mapping**: Map provider-specific HTTP errors and API responses to the unified `tts-error` enumeration with appropriate context preservation\n- **Rate Limiting**: Handle provider-specific rate limits and quota management, implementing appropriate retry logic and error reporting\n- **Long-form Content**: Implement efficient handling of long-form synthesis using provider-native async operations (AWS Polly) or intelligent chunking strategies\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nEach implementation must include comprehensive test suites covering:\n- Basic synthesis operations (text-to-speech with various voices and configurations)\n- Voice discovery and metadata retrieval\n- Streaming synthesis lifecycle (session creation, chunk processing, cleanup)\n- Advanced feature testing (voice cloning, sound effects, custom pronunciations where supported)\n- Audio format validation and quality verification\n- Authentication and authorization scenarios\n- Error handling for unsupported operations and malformed inputs\n- Rate limiting and quota management behavior\n- Connection management and retry logic\n- Long-form content synthesis (>5000 characters)\n- Durability semantics verification across operation boundaries\n- Provider-specific feature utilization (lexicons for Polly, voice settings for ElevenLabs, etc.)\n\n## Configuration Requirements\n\nEach implementation should support the following environment variables:\n\n### Common Configuration\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT`: Custom endpoint URL (for enterprise/regional deployments)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)\n\n### Provider-Specific Configuration\n- **ElevenLabs**: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_MODEL_VERSION`\n- **AWS Polly**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`\n- **Google Cloud**: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`\n- **Deepgram**: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_VERSION`\n\n```wit\npackage

              "body": "I have attached to this ticket a WIT file that describes a generic interface for text-to-speech operations. This interface can be implemented by various providers, either by emulating features not present in a given provider, utilizing the provider's native support for a feature, or indicating an error if a particular combination is not natively supported by a provider.\n\nThe intent of this WIT specification is to allow developers of WASM components (on wasmCloud, Spin, or Golem) to leverage text-to-speech capabilities to build voice-powered applications, accessibility services, and audio content generation systems in a portable and provider-agnostic fashion.\n\nThis ticket involves constructing implementations of this WIT interface for the following providers:\n\n- **ElevenLabs**: The leading AI voice synthesis platform with comprehensive voice cloning, real-time streaming, voice conversion, and sound effects generation capabilities.\n- **AWS Polly**: Amazon's enterprise text-to-speech service with extensive language support, custom lexicons, speech marks, and asynchronous synthesis for long-form content.\n- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech**: Google's neural voice synthesis service with WaveNet and Neural2 voices, device optimization profiles, and streaming synthesis capabilities.\n- **Deepgram Aura**: High-performance real-time TTS with session-based streaming, low-latency neural voices, and conversational AI optimization.\n\nThese implementations must be written in Rust and compilable to WASM Components (WASI 0.23 only, since Golem does not yet support WASI 0.3). The standard Rust toolchain for WASM component development can be employed (see cargo component and the Rust examples of components in this and other Golem repositories).\n\nAdditionally, these implementations should incorporate custom durability semantics using the Golem durability API and the Golem host API. This approach ensures that durability is managed at the level of individual TTS operations (voice synthesis, streaming session creation, voice cloning, batch processing), providing a higher-level and clearer operation log, which aids in debugging and monitoring. See golem:llm and golem:embed for more details and durable implementations in this same repository.\n\nThe final deliverables associated with this ticket are:\n\n- **ElevenLabs implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-elevenlabs.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **AWS Polly implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-polly.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Google Cloud TTS implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-google.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Deepgram Aura implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-deepgram.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n\n**Note**: If you have a strong recommendation to swap out one or two of these with other popular / common TTS providers (such as Azure Cognitive Services Speech, IBM Watson Text to Speech, or OpenAI TTS), then as long as you get permission beforehand, that's okay with me. However, we definitely need ElevenLabs and AWS Polly.\n\nThese components will require runtime configuration, notably API keys, endpoint URLs, authentication credentials, and provider-specific settings. For configuring this information, the components can use environment variables for now (in the future, they will use wasi-runtime-config, but Golem does not support this yet, whereas Golem has good support for environment variables).\n\nMoreover, the Rust components need to be tested within Golem to ensure compatibility with Golem 1.2.x.\n\nThis WIT has been designed by examining and comparing the APIs of ElevenLabs, AWS Polly, Google Cloud TTS, Azure Speech Services, OpenAI TTS, and Deepgram Aura. However, given there are no implementations, it is possible the provided WIT is not the optimal abstraction across all these providers. Therefore, deviations from the proposed design can be made. However, to be accepted, any deviation must be fully justified and deemed by Golem core contributors to be an improvement from the original specification.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\nEach provider implementation should handle the following key mapping considerations:\n\n- **Voice Management**: Map the unified voice resource to provider-specific voice identifiers, handle voice discovery and metadata appropriately for each provider's voice catalog structure\n- **Audio Format Conversion**: Implement native audio format support where available, or provide format conversion for unsupported output formats using audio processing libraries\n- **Streaming Implementation**: Utilize native streaming APIs where supported (ElevenLabs, Deepgram), or implement chunk-based synthesis for providers without native streaming support\n- **Authentication Handling**: Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, service accounts) per provider requirements\n- **Feature Availability**: Route advanced features (voice cloning, sound effects, speech marks) through provider-native APIs where supported, or return `unsupported-operation` errors for unavailable features\n- **Error Mapping**: Map provider-specific HTTP errors and API responses to the unified `tts-error` enumeration with appropriate context preservation\n- **Rate Limiting**: Handle provider-specific rate limits and quota management, implementing appropriate retry logic and error reporting\n- **Long-form Content**: Implement efficient handling of long-form synthesis using provider-native async operations (AWS Polly) or intelligent chunking strategies\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nEach implementation must include comprehensive test suites covering:\n- Basic synthesis operations (text-to-speech with various voices and configurations)\n- Voice discovery and metadata retrieval\n- Streaming synthesis lifecycle (session creation, chunk processing, cleanup)\n- Advanced feature testing (voice cloning, sound effects, custom pronunciations where supported)\n- Audio format validation and quality verification\n- Authentication and authorization scenarios\n- Error handling for unsupported operations and malformed inputs\n- Rate limiting and quota management behavior\n- Connection management and retry logic\n- Long-form content synthesis (>5000 characters)\n- Durability semantics verification across operation boundaries\n- Provider-specific feature utilization (lexicons for Polly, voice settings for ElevenLabs, etc.)\n\n## Configuration Requirements\n\nEach implementation should support the following environment variables:\n\n### Common Configuration\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT`: Custom endpoint URL (for enterprise/regional deployments)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)\n\n### Provider-Specific Configuration\n- **ElevenLabs**: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_MODEL_VERSION`\n- **AWS Polly**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`\n- **Google Cloud**: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`\n- **Deepgram**: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_VERSION`\n\n```wit\npackage

This is making it so I can't use the integration.\r\n\r\nWe also use Fastmail and have been seeing some oddities with the [cal.com](http://cal.com/) integration. Namely, that participants are receiving multiple calendar invites, which on it's own isn't that big of a deal. However, the Fastmail invites are always in UTC, not in the local time of the cal.com invite.\r\n\r\nThis is creating a lot of confusion with participants, they keep missing our meetings, not realizing one invite is UTC and one in local time. I spoke with the Fastmail team and they relayed the following notes about cal's specific integration.\r\n\r\n1. There is a property (SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT) a CalDAV client can add to the event that would prevent CalDAV servers from sending invitations. It appears cal.com is not setting this property even though they are sending an invitation.\r\n2. The invitation being sent by [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is using a different UID. Basically every event has a UID that uniquely identifies the event. Since [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is sending the invitation of the event with a different UID, if you end up adding this event to your calendar [cal.com](http://cal.com/), it will create a duplicate event in your calendar as well. They need to fix it so that all emails associated with a single event use the same original UID.\r\n3. The event added from [cal.com](http://cal.com/) doesn't have a timezone associated with it. Though it mentions the invitees timezone as \"America/Chicago\" in the notes, the event itself doesn't include a timezone and only specifies the time in UTC. Since the event time is specified in UTC, Fastmail's invitation email will also be sent in UTC.\r\n4. There seems to be no way to stop Cal.com from creating the calendar events at all, and thus no real workaround.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

This is making it so I can't use the integration.\r\n\r\nWe also use Fastmail and have been seeing some oddities with the [cal.com](http://cal.com/) integration. Namely, that participants are receiving multiple calendar invites, which on it's own isn't that big of a deal. However, the Fastmail invites are always in UTC, not in the local time of the cal.com invite.\r\n\r\nThis is creating a lot of confusion with participants, they keep missing our meetings, not realizing one invite is UTC and one in local time. I spoke with the Fastmail team and they relayed the following notes about cal's specific integration.\r\n\r\n1. There is a property (SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT) a CalDAV client can add to the event that would prevent CalDAV servers from sending invitations. It appears cal.com is not setting this property even though they are sending an invitation.\r\n2. The invitation being sent by [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is using a different UID. Basically every event has a UID that uniquely identifies the event. Since [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is sending the invitation of the event with a different UID, if you end up adding this event to your calendar [cal.com](http://cal.com/), it will create a duplicate event in your calendar as well. They need to fix it so that all emails associated with a single event use the same original UID.\r\n3. The event added from [cal.com](http://cal.com/) doesn't have a timezone associated with it. Though it mentions the invitees timezone as \"America/Chicago\" in the notes, the event itself doesn't include a timezone and only specifies the time in UTC. Since the event time is specified in UTC, Fastmail's invitation email will also be sent in UTC.\r\n4. There seems to be no way to stop Cal.com from creating the calendar events at all, and thus no real workaround.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Connect to Fastmail using CalDav integration\r\n2. Create a test booking\r\n3. See issues above.\r\n\r\nAny other relevant information. For example, why do you consider this a bug and what did you expect to happen instead?\r\n1. SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT should be set, so Fastmail knows not to send an invitation. **This is the main one.**\r\n2. UID should be unique per event.\r\n3. Event time should have a timezone associated with it.\r\n4. An option could be added to make calendar event creation optional (nice-to-have, not essential).\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\n\r\nNone other than Fastmail/CalDAV.",

The specification is maintained at [[github.com/toon-format/spec](https://github.com/toon-format/spec)](https://github.com/toon-format/spec), currently at version 3.0.\n\n**Design goals:**\n- Minimize token count for LLM context windows\n- Maintain human readability\n- Enable lossless JSON↔TOON conversion\n- Schema-aware encoding for maximum compression\n\n### 1.2 Data Types\n\nTOON supports the complete JSON data model:\n\n| Type | TOON Representation | Example |\n|------|---------------------|---------|\n| String | Unquoted (default) or quoted | `hello` or `\"hello, world\"` |\n| Number | Decimal form only (no scientific notation) | `42`, `3.14159` |\n| Boolean | Lowercase keywords | `true`, `false` |\n| Null | Keyword | `null` |\n| Array | Three formats (see §1.4) | `items[3]: a,b,c` |\n| Object | Indentation-based nesting | See §1.3 |\n\n### 1.3 Object Encoding\n\nObjects use indentation (2 spaces default) with colon-separated key-value pairs:\n\n```toon\nname: Alice\nage: 30\naddress:\n  street: 123 Main St\n  city: Springfield\n```\n\nEquivalent JSON:\n```json\n{\"name\":\"Alice\",\"age\":30,\"address\":{\"street\":\"123 Main St\",\"city\":\"Springfield\"}}\n```\n\n**Key rules:**\n- Keys are unquoted unless they contain special characters\n- Values on the same line as keys (primitives) or indented below (nested structures)\n- Empty objects: just the key with colon and nothing following\n\n### 1.4 Array Encoding Formats\n\nTOON's primary innovation is intelligent array encoding. The format supports three array representations:\n\n#### Tabular Format (Maximum Compression)\n\nFor arrays of uniform objects where all elements share identical keys with only primitive values:\n\n```toon\nusers[3]{id,name,email}:\n  1,Alice,alice@example.com\n  2,Bob,bob@example.com\n  3,Carol,carol@example.com\n```\n\nEquivalent JSON:\n```json\n{\"users\":[{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"Alice\",\"email\":\"alice@example.com\"},{\"id\":2,\"name\":\"Bob\",\"email\":\"bob@example.com\"},{\"id\":3,\"name\":\"Carol\",\"email\":\"carol@example.com\"}]}\n```\n\n**Tabular eligibility requirements:**\n1. All elements must be objects\n2. All objects must have identical keys in the same order\n3. All field values must be primitives (not nested objects or arrays)\n\n#### Inline Format (Primitive Arrays)\n\nFor arrays containing only primitive values:\n\n```toon\ntags[4]: javascript,react,typescript,node\nnumbers[5]: 1,2,3,4,5\n```\n\n#### List Format (Heterogeneous Data)\n\nFor arrays with mixed types, nested structures, or non-uniform objects:\n\n```toon\nitems[3]:\n  - name: Widget\n    price: 9.99\n  - name: Gadget\n    price: 19.99\n  - simple string value\n```\n\n### 1.5 String Quoting Rules\n\nStrings are **unquoted by default**. Quotes are required only when the string contains:\n- The active delimiter (comma by default)\n- A colon `:`\n- Leading or trailing whitespace\n- Control characters\n- The characters `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`\n\n**Escape sequences** (only these five are valid):\n- `\\\\` → backslash\n- `\\\"` → double quote\n- `\\n` → newline\n- `\\r` → carriage return\n- `\\t` → tab\n\n### 1.6 Number Formatting\n\nTOON requires decimal form without scientific notation:\n\n| Value | JSON | TOON |\n|-------|------|------|\n| 15 billion | `1.5e10` | `15000000000` |\n| Tiny | `1e-10` | `0.0000000001` |\n| NaN | N/A | `null` |\n| Infinity | N/A | `null` |\n| -0 | `-0` | `0` |\n\n### 1.7 Key Folding (Optional)\n\nChains of single-key wrapper objects can be collapsed:\n\n```toon\nuser.profile.settings.theme: dark\n```\n\nEquivalent to:\n```toon\nuser:\n  profile:\n    settings:\n      theme: dark\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: ZIO Schema 2 Architecture\n\n### 2.1 Core Abstractions\n\nZIO Schema 2 uses a deriver-based architecture where format codecs are derived from `Schema[A]` definitions. The key components are:\n\n```scala\n// The schema definition\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\nobject Person {\n  implicit val schema: Schema[Person] = Schema.derived\n}\n\n// Deriving a codec\nval jsonCodec: JsonBinaryCodec[Person] = Schema[Person].derive(JsonFormat.deriver)\n```\n\n### 2.2 Deriver Trait\n\nThe `Deriver[TC[_]]` trait defines how to derive type class instances for different schema shapes:\n\n```scala\ntrait Deriver[TC[_]] {\n  def derivePrimitive[F[_, _], A](\n    primitiveType: PrimitiveType[A],\n    typeName: TypeName[A],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Primitive, A],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  ): Lazy[TC[A]]\n\n  def deriveRecord[F[_, _], A](\n    fields: IndexedSeq[Term[F, A, ?]],\n    typeName: TypeName[A],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Record, A],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[A]]\n\n  def deriveVariant[F[_, _], A](\n    cases: IndexedSeq[Term[F, A, ?]],\n    typeName: TypeName[A],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Variant, A],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[A]]\n\n  def deriveSequence[F[_, _], C[_], A](\n    element: Reflect[F, A],\n    typeName: TypeName[C[A]],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Seq[C], C[A]],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[C[A]]]\n\n  def deriveMap[F[_, _], M[_, _], K, V](\n    key: Reflect[F, K],\n    value: Reflect[F, V],\n    typeName: TypeName[M[K, V]],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Map[M], M[K, V]],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[M[K, V]]]\n\n  def deriveDynamic[F[_, _]](\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Dynamic, DynamicValue],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[DynamicValue]]\n\n  def deriveWrapper[F[_, _], A, B](\n    wrapped: Reflect[F, B],\n    typeName: TypeName[A],\n    wrapperPrimitiveType: Option[PrimitiveType[A]],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Wrapper[A, B], A],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[A]]\n}\n```\n\n### 2.3 BinaryCodec Pattern\n\nCodecs extend `BinaryCodec[A]` and work with streaming readers/writers:\n\n```scala\nabstract class JsonBinaryCodec[A](val valueType: Int = JsonBinaryCodec.objectType) \n    extends BinaryCodec[A] {\n  \n  // Core methods to implement\n  def decodeValue(in: JsonReader, default: A): A\n  def encodeValue(x: A, out: JsonWriter): Unit\n  \n  // Optional key encoding (for map keys)\n  def decodeKey(in: JsonReader): A\n  def encodeKey(x: A, out: JsonWriter): Unit\n  \n  // Null value for initialization\n  def nullValue: A = null.asInstanceOf[A]\n  \n  // Public API\n  def decode(input: ByteBuffer, config: ReaderConfig): Either[SchemaError, A]\n  def encode(value: A, output: ByteBuffer, config: WriterConfig): Unit\n}\n```\n\n### 2.4 Configuration Architecture\n\nConfiguration is split between two concerns:\n\n**Semantic configuration** lives on the deriver class itself:\n\n```scala\nclass JsonBinaryCodecDeriver(\n  fieldNameMapper: NameMapper,           // Field name transformation\n  caseNameMapper: NameMapper,            // Case/variant name transformation  \n  discriminatorKind: DiscriminatorKind,  // ADT encoding strategy\n  rejectExtraFields: Boolean,            // Fail on unknown fields\n  enumValuesAsStrings: Boolean,          // Enum encoding style\n  transientNone: Boolean,                // Omit None values\n  requireOptionFields: Boolean,          // Require Option fields\n  transientEmptyCollection: Boolean,     // Omit empty collections\n  requireCollectionFields: Boolean,      // Require collection fields\n  transientDefaultValue: Boolean,        // Omit default-valued fields\n  requireDefaultValueFields: Boolean     // Require fields with defaults\n) extends Deriver[JsonBinaryCodec]\n```\n\n**Runtime configuration** lives in separate config classes:\n\n```scala\n// ReaderConfig: buffer sizes and parsing behavior\nclass ReaderConfig(\n  val preferredBufSize: Int,      // Default: 32768\n  val preferredCharBufSize: Int,  // Default: 4096\n  val maxBufSize: Int,            // Default: 33554432\n  val maxCharBufSize: Int,        // Default: 4194304\n  val checkForEndOfInput: Boolean // Default: true\n)\n\n// WriterConfig: output formatting\nclass WriterConfig(\n  val indentionStep: Int,     // Default: 0 (compact)\n  val preferredBufSize: Int,  // Default: 32768\n  val escapeUnicode: Boolean  // Default: false\n)\n```\n\n### 2.5 DiscriminatorKind for ADTs\n\nSum types (sealed traits) support three encoding strategies:\n\n```scala\nsealed trait DiscriminatorKind\n\nobject DiscriminatorKind {\n  // Wrapper object: {\"Cat\": {\"name\": \"Whiskers\"}}\n  case object Key extends DiscriminatorKind  // DEFAULT\n  \n  // Embedded field: {\"type\": \"Cat\", \"name\": \"Whiskers\"}\n  case class Field(name: String) extends DiscriminatorKind\n  \n  // No discriminator: try each case sequentially\n  case object None extends DiscriminatorKind\n}\n```\n\n### 2.6 NameMapper for Field Transformation\n\n```scala\nsealed trait NameMapper extends (String => String)\n\nobject NameMapper {\n  case object Identity extends NameMapper   // No transformation (default)\n  case object SnakeCase extends NameMapper  // memberName → member_name\n  case object CamelCase extends NameMapper  // member_name → memberName\n  case object PascalCase extends NameMapper // member_name → MemberName\n  case object KebabCase extends NameMapper  // memberName → member-name\n  case class Custom(f: String => String) extends NameMapper\n}\n```\n\n### 2.7 Modifier System\n\nZIO Schema 2 uses `Modifier` classes (not Java annotations) for customization:\n\n```scala\n// Rename a field or case\n@Modifier.rename(\"new_name\")\ncase class Example(field: String)\n\n// Add decoding aliases\n@Modifier.alias(\"old_name\")\ncase object Blue extends Color\n\n// Mark field as transient (excluded from serialization)\n@Modifier.transient()\nval internalField: Int = 0\n```\n\nProgrammatic application:\n```scala\nval codec = Color.schema\n  .deriving(JsonBinaryCodecDeriver)\n  .modifier(Color.red, Modifier.rename(\"Rose\"))\n  .modifier(Color.red, Modifier.alias(\"Ruby\"))\n  .derive\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 3: TOON Implementation Design\n\n### 3.1 Module

\"\\n\"\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 4: Encoding Rules and Algorithms\n\n### 4.1 Array Format Selection Algorithm\n\nWhen `ArrayFormat.Auto` is configured, the encoder must analyze array contents:\n\n```scala\ndef selectArrayFormat[A](elements: Iterable[A], elementCodec: ToonBinaryCodec[A]): ArrayFormat = {\n  if (elements.isEmpty) {\n    ArrayFormat.Inline  // Empty arrays: items[0]:\n  } else if (isPrimitiveCodec(elementCodec)) {\n    ArrayFormat.Inline  // Primitive arrays: items[3]: a,b,c\n  } else if (isUniformObjectArray(elements)) {\n    ArrayFormat.Tabular // Uniform objects: items[N]{fields}: rows...\n  } else {\n    ArrayFormat.List    // Everything else: - item format\n  }\n}\n\ndef isUniformObjectArray[A](elements: Iterable[A]): Boolean = {\n  // Check that:\n  // 1. All elements are objects (case classes)\n  // 2. All have identical field names in same order\n  // 3. All field values are primitives (not nested objects/arrays)\n  ???\n}\n```\n\n### 4.2 String Encoding Rules\n\n```scala\ndef requiresQuoting(s: String, delimiter: Char): Boolean = {\n  s.isEmpty ||\n  s.charAt(0).isWhitespace ||\n  s.charAt(s.length - 1).isWhitespace ||\n  s.indexOf(delimiter) >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf(':') >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf('{') >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf('}') >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf('[') >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf(']') >= 0 ||\n  containsControlCharacters(s)\n}\n\ndef encodeString(s: String, delimiter: Char, out: ToonWriter): Unit = {\n  if (requiresQuoting(s, delimiter)) {\n    out.writeQuotedString(s)  // Escape \\, \", \\n, \\r, \\t\n  } else {\n    out.writeRawString(s)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4.3 Number Encoding Rules\n\n```scala\ndef encodeNumber(n: BigDecimal, out: ToonWriter): Unit = {\n  if (n.isNaN || n.isInfinity) {\n    out.writeNull()\n  } else if (n == BigDecimal(0) && n.signum < 0) {\n    out.writeRaw(\"0\")  // Normalize -0 to 0\n  } else {\n    // Convert to non-exponential decimal form\n    out.writeRaw(n.bigDecimal.toPlainString)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4.4 ADT Encoding with Discriminators\n\n**DiscriminatorKind.Key (default):**\n```toon\nCat:\n  name: Whiskers\n  lives: 9\n```\n\n**DiscriminatorKind.Field(\"type\"):**\n```toon\ntype: Cat\nname: Whiskers\nlives: 9\n```\n\n**DiscriminatorKind.None:**\n```toon\nname: Whiskers\nlives: 9\n```\n(Decoder tries each case sequentially)\n\n### 4.5 Tabular Array Encoding\n\nFor uniform object arrays:\n\n```scala\ndef encodeTabularArray[A](\n  fieldName: String,\n  elements: IndexedSeq[A],\n  fieldNames: IndexedSeq[String],\n  fieldCodecs: IndexedSeq[ToonBinaryCodec[?]],\n  out: ToonWriter\n): Unit = {\n  // Header: fieldName[count]{field1,field2,...}:\n  out.writeRaw(fieldName)\n  out.writeRaw(\"[\")\n  out.writeRaw(elements.length.toString)\n  out.writeRaw(\"]{\")\n  out.writeRaw(fieldNames.mkString(\",\"))\n  out.writeRaw(\"}:\")\n  out.newLine()\n  \n  // Rows: value1,value2,...\n  elements.foreach { element =>\n    out.writeIndent()\n    fieldCodecs.zipWithIndex.foreach { case (codec, idx) =>\n      if (idx > 0) out.writeRaw(\",\")\n      codec.encodeValue(getField(element, idx), out)\n    }\n    out.newLine()\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 5: Acceptance Criteria\n\n### 5.1 Functional Requirements\n\n#### Primitive Types\n- [ ] All

TOON is a compact, human-readable serialization format designed to minimize token usage when passing structured data to Large Language Models, achieving 30-60% token reduction compared to JSON while maintaining lossless bidirectional conversion.\n\nThe implementation will follow the established patterns in zio-blocks, mirroring the architecture of `JsonBinaryCodecDeriver` while adding TOON-specific capabilities for array format selection and indentation-based structure.\n\n---\n\n## Part 1: TOON Format Specification\n\n### 1.1 Overview\n\nTOON was created by Johann Schopplich in 2025 to address the inefficiency of JSON when used in LLM prompts. The format combines YAML-style indentation with CSV-style tabular data representation. The specification is maintained at [[github.com/toon-format/spec](https://github.com/toon-format/spec)](https://github.com/toon-format/spec), currently at version 3.0.\n\n**Design goals:**\n- Minimize token count for LLM context windows\n- Maintain human readability\n- Enable lossless JSON↔TOON conversion\n- Schema-aware encoding for maximum compression\n\n### 1.2 Data Types\n\nTOON supports the complete JSON data model:\n\n| Type | TOON Representation | Example |\n|------|---------------------|---------|\n| String | Unquoted (default) or quoted | `hello` or `\"hello, world\"` |\n| Number | Decimal form only (no scientific notation) | `42`, `3.14159` |\n| Boolean | Lowercase keywords | `true`, `false` |\n| Null | Keyword | `null` |\n| Array | Three formats (see §1.4) | `items[3]: a,b,c` |\n| Object | Indentation-based nesting | See §1.3 |\n\n### 1.3 Object Encoding\n\nObjects use indentation (2 spaces default) with colon-separated key-value pairs:\n\n```toon\nname: Alice\nage: 30\naddress:\n  street: 123 Main St\n  city: Springfield\n```\n\nEquivalent JSON:\n```json\n{\"name\":\"Alice\",\"age\":30,\"address\":{\"street\":\"123 Main St\",\"city\":\"Springfield\"}}\n```\n\n**Key rules:**\n- Keys are unquoted unless they contain special characters\n- Values on the same line as keys (primitives) or indented below (nested structures)\n- Empty objects: just the key with colon and nothing following\n\n### 1.4 Array Encoding Formats\n\nTOON's primary innovation is intelligent array encoding. The format supports three array representations:\n\n#### Tabular Format (Maximum Compression)\n\nFor arrays of uniform objects where all elements share identical keys with only primitive values:\n\n```toon\nusers[3]{id,name,email}:\n  1,Alice,alice@example.com\n  2,Bob,bob@example.com\n  3,Carol,carol@example.com\n```\n\nEquivalent JSON:\n```json\n{\"users\":[{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"Alice\",\"email\":\"alice@example.com\"},{\"id\":2,\"name\":\"Bob\",\"email\":\"bob@example.com\"},{\"id\":3,\"name\":\"Carol\",\"email\":\"carol@example.com\"}]}\n```\n\n**Tabular eligibility requirements:**\n1. All elements must be objects\n2. All objects must have identical keys in the same order\n3. All field values must be primitives (not nested objects or arrays)\n\n#### Inline Format (Primitive Arrays)\n\nFor arrays containing only primitive values:\n\n```toon\ntags[4]: javascript,react,typescript,node\nnumbers[5]: 1,2,3,4,5\n```\n\n#### List Format (Heterogeneous Data)\n\nFor arrays with mixed types, nested structures, or non-uniform objects:\n\n```toon\nitems[3]:\n  - name: Widget\n    price: 9.99\n  - name: Gadget\n    price: 19.99\n  - simple string value\n```\n\n### 1.5 String Quoting Rules\n\nStrings are **unquoted by default**. Quotes are required only when the string contains:\n- The active delimiter (comma by default)\n- A colon `:`\n- Leading or trailing whitespace\n- Control characters\n- The characters `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`\n\n**Escape sequences** (only these five are valid):\n- `\\\\` → backslash\n- `\\\"` → double quote\n- `\\n` → newline\n- `\\r` → carriage return\n- `\\t` → tab\n\n### 1.6 Number Formatting\n\nTOON requires decimal form without scientific notation:\n\n| Value | JSON | TOON |\n|-------|------|------|\n| 15 billion | `1.5e10` | `15000000000` |\n| Tiny | `1e-10` | `0.0000000001` |\n| NaN | N/A | `null` |\n| Infinity | N/A | `null` |\n| -0 | `-0` | `0` |\n\n### 1.7 Key Folding (Optional)\n\nChains of single-key wrapper objects can be collapsed:\n\n```toon\nuser.profile.settings.theme: dark\n```\n\nEquivalent to:\n```toon\nuser:\n  profile:\n    settings:\n      theme: dark\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: ZIO Schema 2 Architecture\n\n### 2.1 Core Abstractions\n\nZIO Schema 2 uses a deriver-based architecture where format codecs are derived from `Schema[A]` definitions. The key components are:\n\n```scala\n// The schema definition\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\nobject Person {\n  implicit val schema: Schema[Person] = Schema.derived\n}\n\n// Deriving a codec\nval jsonCodec: JsonBinaryCodec[Person] = Schema[Person].derive(JsonFormat.deriver)\n```\n\n### 2.2 Deriver Trait\n\nThe `Deriver[TC[_]]` trait defines how to derive type class instances for different schema shapes:\n\n```scala\ntrait Deriver[TC[_]] {\n  def derivePrimitive[F[_, _], A](\n    primitiveType: PrimitiveType[A],\n    typeName: TypeName[A],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Primitive, A],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  ): Lazy[TC[A]]\n\n  def deriveRecord[F[_, _], A](\n    fields: IndexedSeq[Term[F, A, ?]],\n    typeName: TypeName[A],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Record, A],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[A]]\n\n  def deriveVariant[F[_, _], A](\n    cases: IndexedSeq[Term[F, A, ?]],\n    typeName: TypeName[A],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Variant, A],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[A]]\n\n  def deriveSequence[F[_, _], C[_], A](\n    element: Reflect[F, A],\n    typeName: TypeName[C[A]],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Seq[C], C[A]],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[C[A]]]\n\n  def deriveMap[F[_, _], M[_, _], K, V](\n    key: Reflect[F, K],\n    value: Reflect[F, V],\n    typeName: TypeName[M[K, V]],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Map[M], M[K, V]],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[M[K, V]]]\n\n  def deriveDynamic[F[_, _]](\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Dynamic, DynamicValue],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[DynamicValue]]\n\n  def deriveWrapper[F[_, _], A, B](\n    wrapped: Reflect[F, B],\n    typeName: TypeName[A],\n    wrapperPrimitiveType: Option[PrimitiveType[A]],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Wrapper[A, B], A],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[A]]\n}\n```\n\n### 2.3 BinaryCodec Pattern\n\nCodecs extend `BinaryCodec[A]` and work with streaming readers/writers:\n\n```scala\nabstract class JsonBinaryCodec[A](val valueType: Int = JsonBinaryCodec.objectType) \n    extends BinaryCodec[A] {\n  \n  // Core methods to implement\n  def decodeValue(in: JsonReader, default: A): A\n  def encodeValue(x: A, out: JsonWriter): Unit\n  \n  // Optional key encoding (for map keys)\n  def decodeKey(in: JsonReader): A\n  def encodeKey(x: A, out: JsonWriter): Unit\n  \n  // Null value for initialization\n  def nullValue: A = null.asInstanceOf[A]\n  \n  // Public API\n  def decode(input: ByteBuffer, config: ReaderConfig): Either[SchemaError, A]\n  def encode(value: A, output: ByteBuffer, config: WriterConfig): Unit\n}\n```\n\n### 2.4 Configuration Architecture\n\nConfiguration is split between two concerns:\n\n**Semantic configuration** lives on the deriver class itself:\n\n```scala\nclass JsonBinaryCodecDeriver(\n  fieldNameMapper: NameMapper,           // Field name transformation\n  caseNameMapper: NameMapper,            // Case/variant name transformation  \n  discriminatorKind: DiscriminatorKind,  // ADT encoding strategy\n  rejectExtraFields: Boolean,            // Fail on unknown fields\n  enumValuesAsStrings: Boolean,          // Enum encoding style\n  transientNone: Boolean,                // Omit None values\n  requireOptionFields: Boolean,          // Require Option fields\n  transientEmptyCollection: Boolean,     // Omit empty collections\n  requireCollectionFields: Boolean,      // Require collection fields\n  transientDefaultValue: Boolean,        // Omit default-valued fields\n  requireDefaultValueFields: Boolean     // Require fields with defaults\n) extends Deriver[JsonBinaryCodec]\n```\n\n**Runtime configuration** lives in separate config classes:\n\n```scala\n// ReaderConfig: buffer sizes and parsing behavior\nclass ReaderConfig(\n  val preferredBufSize: Int,      // Default: 32768\n  val preferredCharBufSize: Int,  // Default: 4096\n  val maxBufSize: Int,            // Default: 33554432\n  val maxCharBufSize: Int,        // Default: 4194304\n  val checkForEndOfInput: Boolean // Default: true\n)\n\n// WriterConfig: output formatting\nclass WriterConfig(\n  val indentionStep: Int,     // Default: 0 (compact)\n  val preferredBufSize: Int,  // Default: 32768\n  val escapeUnicode: Boolean  // Default: false\n)\n```\n\n### 2.5 DiscriminatorKind for ADTs\n\nSum types (sealed traits) support three encoding strategies:\n\n```scala\nsealed trait DiscriminatorKind\n\nobject DiscriminatorKind {\n  // Wrapper object: {\"Cat\": {\"name\": \"Whiskers\"}}\n  case object Key extends DiscriminatorKind  // DEFAULT\n  \n  // Embedded field: {\"type\": \"Cat\", \"name\": \"Whiskers\"}\n  case class Field(name: String) extends DiscriminatorKind\n  \n  // No discriminator: try each case sequentially\n  case object None extends DiscriminatorKind\n}\n```\n\n### 2.6 NameMapper for Field Transformation\n\n```scala\nsealed trait NameMapper extends (String => String)\n\nobject NameMapper {\n  case object Identity extends NameMapper   // No transformation (default)\n  case object SnakeCase extends NameMapper  // memberName → member_name\n  case object CamelCase extends NameMapper  // member_name → memberName\n  case object PascalCase extends NameMapper // member_name → MemberName\n  case object KebabCase extends NameMapper  // memberName → member-name\n  case class Custom(f: String => String)

case\n@Modifier.rename(\"new_name\")\ncase class Example(field: String)\n\n// Add decoding aliases\n@Modifier.alias(\"old_name\")\ncase object Blue extends Color\n\n// Mark field as transient (excluded from serialization)\n@Modifier.transient()\nval internalField: Int = 0\n```\n\nProgrammatic application:\n```scala\nval codec = Color.schema\n  .deriving(JsonBinaryCodecDeriver)\n  .modifier(Color.red, Modifier.rename(\"Rose\"))\n  .modifier(Color.red, Modifier.alias(\"Ruby\"))\n  .derive\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 3: TOON Implementation Design\n\n### 3.1 Module

contents:\n\n```scala\ndef selectArrayFormat[A](elements: Iterable[A], elementCodec: ToonBinaryCodec[A]): ArrayFormat = {\n  if (elements.isEmpty) {\n    ArrayFormat.Inline  // Empty arrays: items[0]:\n  } else if (isPrimitiveCodec(elementCodec)) {\n    ArrayFormat.Inline  // Primitive arrays: items[3]: a,b,c\n  } else if (isUniformObjectArray(elements)) {\n    ArrayFormat.Tabular // Uniform objects: items[N]{fields}: rows...\n  } else {\n    ArrayFormat.List    // Everything else: - item format\n  }\n}\n\ndef isUniformObjectArray[A](elements: Iterable[A]): Boolean = {\n  // Check that:\n  // 1. All elements are objects (case classes)\n  // 2. All have identical field names in same order\n  // 3. All field values are primitives (not nested objects/arrays)\n  ???\n}\n```\n\n### 4.2 String Encoding Rules\n\n```scala\ndef requiresQuoting(s: String, delimiter: Char): Boolean = {\n  s.isEmpty ||\n  s.charAt(0).isWhitespace ||\n  s.charAt(s.length - 1).isWhitespace ||\n  s.indexOf(delimiter) >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf(':') >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf('{') >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf('}') >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf('[') >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf(']') >= 0 ||\n  containsControlCharacters(s)\n}\n\ndef encodeString(s: String, delimiter: Char, out: ToonWriter): Unit = {\n  if (requiresQuoting(s, delimiter)) {\n    out.writeQuotedString(s)  // Escape \\, \", \\n, \\r, \\t\n  } else {\n    out.writeRawString(s)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4.3 Number Encoding Rules\n\n```scala\ndef encodeNumber(n: BigDecimal, out: ToonWriter): Unit = {\n  if (n.isNaN || n.isInfinity) {\n    out.writeNull()\n  } else if (n == BigDecimal(0) && n.signum < 0) {\n    out.writeRaw(\"0\")  // Normalize -0 to 0\n  } else {\n    // Convert to non-exponential decimal form\n    out.writeRaw(n.bigDecimal.toPlainString)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4.4 ADT Encoding with Discriminators\n\n**DiscriminatorKind.Key (default):**\n```toon\nCat:\n  name: Whiskers\n  lives: 9\n```\n\n**DiscriminatorKind.Field(\"type\"):**\n```toon\ntype: Cat\nname: Whiskers\nlives: 9\n```\n\n**DiscriminatorKind.None:**\n```toon\nname: Whiskers\nlives: 9\n```\n(Decoder tries each case sequentially)\n\n### 4.5 Tabular Array Encoding\n\nFor uniform object arrays:\n\n```scala\ndef encodeTabularArray[A](\n  fieldName: String,\n  elements: IndexedSeq[A],\n  fieldNames: IndexedSeq[String],\n  fieldCodecs: IndexedSeq[ToonBinaryCodec[?]],\n  out: ToonWriter\n): Unit = {\n  // Header: fieldName[count]{field1,field2,...}:\n  out.writeRaw(fieldName)\n  out.writeRaw(\"[\")\n  out.writeRaw(elements.length.toString)\n  out.writeRaw(\"]{\")\n  out.writeRaw(fieldNames.mkString(\",\"))\n  out.writeRaw(\"}:\")\n  out.newLine()\n  \n  // Rows: value1,value2,...\n  elements.foreach { element =>\n    out.writeIndent()\n    fieldCodecs.zipWithIndex.foreach { case (codec, idx) =>\n      if (idx > 0) out.writeRaw(\",\")\n      codec.encodeValue(getField(element, idx), out)\n    }\n    out.newLine()\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 5: Acceptance Criteria\n\n### 5.1 Functional Requirements\n\n#### Primitive Types\n- [ ] All primitive types encode/decode correctly: Unit, Boolean, Byte, Short, Int, Long, Float, Double, Char, String, BigInt, BigDecimal\n- [ ] All java.time types: Instant, LocalDate, LocalTime,

Configuration reference\n\n---\n\n## Part 6: Reference Implementation Notes\n\n### 6.1 Existing TOON Libraries\n\n**toon4s** (github.com/vim89/toon4s) provides a Scala TOON implementation with:\n- Sealed ADT for TOON values: `ToonValue = TNull | TBool | TNumber | TString | TArray | TObj`\n- JSON↔TOON bidirectional conversion\n- Does NOT provide automatic derivation for case classes\n\n**TypeScript SDK** (github.com/toon-format/toon) is the reference implementation with:\n- Complete parser and serializer\n- Schema-aware encoding\n- Comprehensive test suite\n\n### 6.2 JSON Codec Reference\n\nThe `JsonBinaryCodecDeriver` in zio-blocks serves as the primary reference for implementation patterns:\n- Thread-local caching for recursive types\n- Field info classes for optimized encoding\n- String map for O(1) field lookup during decoding\n- Specialized codecs for primitive arrays\n\n### 6.3 Test Data\n\nThe TOON specification repository includes a test suite at

You have a current type:\n\n   ```scala\n   @schema\n   case class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n   ```\n\n2. You derive and copy its structural shape:\n\n   ```scala\n   type PersonV1 = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n   ```\n\n3. You evolve the real type:\n\n   ```scala\n   @schema\n   case class Person(fullName: String, age: Int, country: String)\n   ```\n\n4. You keep only:\n\n   * the **current** runtime type\n   * the **structural type** for the old version\n   * a **pure migration** between them\n\nNo old case classes. No old optics. No runtime baggage.\n\nNote there is no requirement that the \"current\" type actually be a real case class, enum, etc.--so you can work purely with structural types, allowing you to define migrations for data types that are never materialized as runtime structures.\n\n---\n\n### Why pure data migrations?\n\nMigrations are represented entirely as **pure data**:\n\n* no user functions\n* no closures\n* no reflection\n* no runtime code generation\n\nAs a result:\n\n* migrations can be **serialized**\n* stored in **registries**\n* applied **dynamically**\n* inspected and transformed\n* used to generate:\n\n  * upgraders\n  * downgraders\n  * SQL DDL / DML\n  * offline data transforms\n\nWhile code generation is **out of scope for this ticket**, this explains many design decisions (invertibility, path-based actions, no functions).\n\n---\n\n## Core Architecture\n\n### Type Hierarchy\n\n```scala\n// Typed migration (user-facing API)\ncase class Migration[A, B](\n  dynamicMigration: DynamicMigration,\n  sourceSchema: Schema[A], // These are structural schemas!!!\n  targetSchema: Schema[B] // These are structural schemas!!!\n) {\n  /** Apply migration to transform A to B */\n  def apply(value: A): Either[MigrationError, B]\n\n  /** Compose migrations sequentially */\n  def ++[C](that: Migration[B, C]): Migration[A, C]\n\n  /** Alias for ++ */\n  def andThen[C](that: Migration[B, C]): Migration[A, C] = this ++ that\n\n  /** Reverse migration (structural inverse; runtime is best-effort) */\n  def reverse: Migration[B, A]\n}\n```\n\n```scala\n// Untyped migration (pure data, fully serializable)\ncase class DynamicMigration(\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) {\n  def apply(value: DynamicValue): Either[MigrationError, DynamicValue]\n  def ++(that: DynamicMigration): DynamicMigration\n  def reverse: DynamicMigration\n}\n```\n\n* `Migration[A, B]` is introspectable, but not pure data due to bindings inside schemas\n* `DynamicMigration` is **fully serializable**\n\n---\n\n## User-Facing API: Selector Expressions\n\n### Selectors, not optics\n\nThe user-facing API **does not expose optics**.\n\nInstead, all locations are specified using **selector expressions**:\n\n```scala\nS => A\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```scala\n_.name\n_.address.street\n_.addresses.each.streetNumber\n_.country.when[UK]\n```\n\nTo see the syntax, one can look at the `optic` macro, which utilizes the same selector syntax for optic creation (e.g. `optic(_.address.street)`, etc.).\n\n### Macro extraction\n\nAll builder methods that accept selectors are **implemented via macros** (or via a macro-generated type class such as `ToDynamicOptic`).\n\nThe macro:\n\n1. Inspects the selector expression\n2. Validates it is a supported projection\n3. Converts it into a `DynamicOptic`\n4.

For simplicity, these are shown as functions (e.g. `A => Any`), but this is NOT the way to implement them. Either all these functions need to be macros, or a macro needs to be used to generate an implicit / given at each call site. Macros may do additional validation to constrain the validity of these different types of transformations.\n\n```scala\nclass MigrationBuilder[A, B](\n  sourceSchema: Schema[A],\n  targetSchema: Schema[B],\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) {\n\n  // ----- Record operations -----\n\n  def addField(\n    target: B => Any,\n    default: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def dropField(\n    source: A => Any,\n    defaultForReverse: SchemaExpr[B, ?] = SchemaExpr.DefaultValue\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def renameField(\n    from: A => Any,\n    to: B => Any\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformField(\n    from: A => Any,\n    to: B => Any,\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def mandateField(\n    source: A => Option[?],\n    target: B => Any,\n    default: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def optionalizeField(\n    source: A => Any,\n    target: B => Option[?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def changeFieldType(\n    source: A => Any,\n    target: B => Any,\n    converter: SchemaExpr[A, ?]  // primitive-to-primitive only\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Enum operations (limited) -----\n\n  def renameCase[SumA, SumB](\n    from: String,\n    to: String\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformCase[SumA, CaseA, SumB, CaseB](\n    caseMigration: MigrationBuilder[CaseA, CaseB] => MigrationBuilder[CaseA, CaseB]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Collections -----\n\n  def transformElements(\n    at: A => Vector[?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Maps -----\n\n  def transformKeys(\n    at: A => Map[?, ?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformValues(\n    at: A => Map[?, ?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  /** Build migration with full macro validation */\n  def build: Migration[A, B]\n\n  /** Build migration without full validation */\n  def buildPartial: Migration[A, B]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Migration Actions (Untyped Core)\n\nAll actions operate at a **path**, represented by `DynamicOptic`.\n\n```scala\nsealed trait MigrationAction {\n  def at: DynamicOptic\n  def reverse: MigrationAction\n}\n```\n\n### Record Actions\n\n```scala\ncase class AddField(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  default: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class DropField(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  defaultForReverse: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Rename(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  to: String\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformValue(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Mandate(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  default: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Optionalize(\n  at: DynamicOptic\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Join(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  sourcePaths: Vector[DynamicOptic],\n  combiner: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Split(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  targetPaths: Vector[DynamicOptic],\n  splitter: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class ChangeType(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  converter: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n---\n\n### Enum Actions (Supported)\n\n```scala\ncase class RenameCase(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  from: String,\n  to: String\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformCase(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n> Enum case addition / removal is **out of scope** for this ticket\n> (requires composite value construction).\n\n---\n\n### Collection / Map Actions\n\n```scala\ncase class TransformElements(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformKeys(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformValues(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n---\n\n## SchemaExpr Integration\n\n* Used for all value-level transformations\n* **Constraints for this ticket**:\n\n  * primitive → primitive only\n  * joins / splits must produce primitives\n  * no record / enum construction\n\n### `SchemaExpr.DefaultValue`\n\nA special expression that:\n\n1. uses the macro-captured field schema\n2. calls `schema.defaultValue`\n3. converts the value to `DynamicValue`\n4. is stored for reverse migrations\n\n---\n\n## Type Modeling\n\n### Records (Structural Types)\n\n```scala\ntype PersonV0 = { val firstName: String;

def number: String; def exp: String }\ntype OldWireTransfer =\n  { type Tag = \"WireTransfer\"; def account: String; def routing: String }\ntype OldPaymentMethod = OldCreditCard | OldWireTransfer\n```\n\nMacros extract:\n\n* refinement type → structure of the case\n* type `Tag` with singleton type → case tag\n\n---\n\n## Laws\n\n### Identity\n\n```scala\nMigration.identity[A].apply(a) == Right(a)\n```\n\n### Associativity\n\n```scala\n(m1 ++ m2) ++ m3 == m1 ++ (m2 ++ m3)\n```\n\n### Structural Reverse\n\n```scala\nm.reverse.reverse == m\n```\n\n### Best-Effort Semantic Inverse\n\n```scala\nm.apply(a) == Right(b) ⇒ m.reverse.apply(b) == Right(a)\n```\n\n(when sufficient information exists)\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\n* All runtime errors return `MigrationError`\n* Errors must capture **path information** (`DynamicOptic`)\n* Enables diagnostics such as:\n\n> “Failed to apply TransformValue at `.addresses.each.streetNumber`”\n\n---\n\n## Example\n\n```scala\ntype PersonV0 = { val firstName: String; val lastName: String }\n\n@schema\ncase class Person(fullName: String, age: Int)\n\nval migration =\n  Migration.newBuilder[PersonV0, Person]\n    .addField(_.age, 0)\n    .build\n\nval old =\n  new { val firstName = \"John\"; val lastName = \"Doe\" }\n\nmigration(old)\n// Right(Person(\"John Doe\", 0))\n```\n\n---\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n* [ ] `DynamicMigration` fully serializable\n* [ ] `Migration[A, B]` wraps schemas and actions\n* [ ] All actions path-based via `DynamicOptic`\n* [ ] User API uses selector functions (`S => A`) for \"optics\" on old and new types\n* [ ] Macro validation in `.build` to confirm \"old\" has been migrated to \"new\"\n* [ ] `.buildPartial` supported\n* [ ] Structural reverse implemented\n* [ ] Identity & associativity laws hold\n* [ ] Enum rename / transform supported\n* [ ] Errors include path information\n* [ ] Comprehensive tests\n* [ ] Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.5+ supported\n",

Macros may do additional validation to constrain the validity of these different types of transformations.\n\n```scala\nclass MigrationBuilder[A, B](\n  sourceSchema: Schema[A],\n  targetSchema: Schema[B],\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) {\n\n  // ----- Record operations -----\n\n  def addField(\n    target: B => Any,\n    default: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def dropField(\n    source: A => Any,\n    defaultForReverse: SchemaExpr[B, ?] = SchemaExpr.DefaultValue\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def renameField(\n    from: A => Any,\n    to: B => Any\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformField(\n    from: A => Any,\n    to: B => Any,\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def mandateField(\n    source: A => Option[?],\n    target: B => Any,\n    default: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def optionalizeField(\n    source: A => Any,\n    target: B => Option[?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def changeFieldType(\n    source: A => Any,\n    target: B => Any,\n    converter: SchemaExpr[A, ?]  // primitive-to-primitive only\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Enum operations (limited) -----\n\n  def renameCase[SumA, SumB](\n    from: String,\n    to: String\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformCase[SumA, CaseA, SumB, CaseB](\n    caseMigration: MigrationBuilder[CaseA, CaseB] => MigrationBuilder[CaseA, CaseB]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Collections -----\n\n  def transformElements(\n    at: A => Vector[?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Maps -----\n\n  def transformKeys(\n    at: A => Map[?, ?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformValues(\n    at: A => Map[?, ?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  /** Build migration with full macro validation */\n  def build: Migration[A, B]\n\n  /** Build migration without full validation */\n  def buildPartial: Migration[A, B]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Migration Actions (Untyped Core)\n\nAll actions operate at a **path**, represented by `DynamicOptic`.\n\n```scala\nsealed trait MigrationAction {\n  def at: DynamicOptic\n  def reverse: MigrationAction\n}\n```\n\n### Record Actions\n\n```scala\ncase class AddField(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  default: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class DropField(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  defaultForReverse: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Rename(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  to: String\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformValue(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Mandate(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  default: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Optionalize(\n  at: DynamicOptic\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Join(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  sourcePaths: Vector[DynamicOptic],\n  combiner: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Split(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  targetPaths: Vector[DynamicOptic],\n  splitter: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class ChangeType(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  converter: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n---\n\n### Enum Actions (Supported)\n\n```scala\ncase class RenameCase(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  from: String,\n  to: String\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformCase(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n> Enum case addition / removal is **out of scope** for this ticket\n> (requires composite value construction).\n\n---\n\n### Collection / Map Actions\n\n```scala\ncase class TransformElements(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformKeys(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformValues(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n---\n\n## SchemaExpr Integration\n\n* Used for all value-level transformations\n* **Constraints for this ticket**:\n\n  * primitive → primitive only\n  * joins / splits must produce primitives\n  * no record / enum construction\n\n### `SchemaExpr.DefaultValue`\n\nA special expression that:\n\n1. uses the macro-captured field schema\n2. calls `schema.defaultValue`\n3. converts the value to `DynamicValue`\n4. is stored for reverse migrations\n\n---\n\n## Type Modeling\n\n### Records (Structural Types)\n\n```scala\ntype PersonV0 = { val firstName: String; val lastName: String }\ntype PersonV1 = { val fullName: String; val age: Int }\n\nimplicit val v0Schema: Schema[PersonV0] = Schema.structural[PersonV0]\nimplicit val v1Schema: Schema[PersonV1] = Schema.structural[PersonV1]\n```\n\n---\n\n### Enums (Union of Structural Types with Tags)\n\nEnums are encoded into structural types by using union types, together with singleton types (string literals, which represent the name of the case of the enum).\n\nIn structural types, the names of the type aliases shown below are not relevant, nor are they used.\n\n```scala\ntype OldCreditCard =\n  { type Tag = \"CreditCard\"; def number: String; def exp: String }\ntype OldWireTransfer =\n  { type Tag = \"WireTransfer\"; def account: String; def routing: String }\ntype OldPaymentMethod = OldCreditCard | OldWireTransfer\n```\n\nMacros extract:\n\n* refinement type → structure of the case\n* type `Tag` with singleton type → case tag\n\n---\n\n## Laws\n\n### Identity\n\n```scala\nMigration.identity[A].apply(a) == Right(a)\n```\n\n### Associativity\n\n```scala\n(m1 ++ m2) ++ m3 == m1 ++ (m2 ++ m3)\n```\n\n### Structural Reverse\n\n```scala\nm.reverse.reverse == m\n```\n\n### Best-Effort Semantic Inverse\n\n```scala\nm.apply(a) == Right(b) ⇒ m.reverse.apply(b) == Right(a)\n```\n\n(when sufficient information exists)\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\n* All runtime errors return `MigrationError`\n* Errors must capture **path information** (`DynamicOptic`)\n* Enables diagnostics such as:\n\n> “Failed to apply TransformValue at `.addresses.each.streetNumber`”\n\n---\n\n## Example\n\n```scala\ntype PersonV0 = { val firstName: String; val lastName: String }\n\n@schema\ncase class Person(fullName: String, age: Int)\n\nval migration =\n  Migration.newBuilder[PersonV0, Person]\n    .addField(_.age, 0)\n    .build\n\nval old =\n  new { val firstName = \"John\"; val lastName = \"Doe\" }\n\nmigration(old)\n// Right(Person(\"John Doe\", 0))\n```\n\n---\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n* [ ] `DynamicMigration` fully serializable\n* [ ] `Migration[A, B]` wraps schemas and actions\n* [ ] All actions path-based via `DynamicOptic`\n* [ ] User API uses selector functions (`S => A`) for \"optics\" on old and new types\n* [ ] Macro validation in `.build` to confirm \"old\" has been migrated to \"new\"\n* [ ] `.buildPartial` supported\n* [ ] Structural reverse implemented\n* [ ] Identity & associativity laws hold\n* [ ] Enum rename / transform supported\n* [ ] Errors include path information\n* [ ] Comprehensive tests\n* [ ] Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.5+ supported\n",
