The backup timeout is not really passed to the SSH process to increase that timeout as well. \n> This is either an oversight or there is a specific reason why a SSH process shouldn't linger more then 3600 seconds. \n> But yes, feel free to open a new issue about it. \n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Configure a database and then backups.\n2. Use the Timeout option in the dashboard to set a custom timeout, eg 10800 (default 3600 seconds)\n3. Click on Backup Now\n4.

The current backup system is good, but starts to have failures for larger DBs. The current backup system also causes huge S3 bills for larger DBs (ex. nightly backups of 100gb DBs start to add up).\n\nThis must also support the backups API.\n\n$1,000 USD bounty once this is merged into https://app.coolify.io's/ instance and I've verified it works on Postgres DBs with 100gb of data in them.\n\n---\n\nThis bounty is funded by [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/), a charity that supports teenagers who love computers and electronics! We previously funded database SSL support and the creation of the backups API.",

Instead, I want to invite them to a specific project on Coolify and for them to only have access to that project.\n\nAdditionally, I want to optionally allow the project-specific member to deploy their own apps on the servers on the account. This will just create a new project in the Team with them as a project-specific member.\n\nI should be able to manage all project-specific members from the main team page in addition to on each project’s page.\n\nAny APIs that exist for managing team members should also work for project-specific members.\n\nThe purpose of this bounty is to create a secure way to give people limited access to projects on Coolify. They must not be able to break out of their permissions. For example, if I can SSH into a server as a project member using one of the keys - that would allow me to break out of my permissions.\n\nAcceptance criteria: Once your PR is merged and deployed on Coolify Cloud, I will test the features and award the bounty. Thanks!\n\n[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) previously awarded bounties to implement database SSL and APIs to manage backups. We’re a nonprofit for teenage coders!",

              "body": "### Request Type\n\nNew Feature\n\n### Description\n\n$1,000 USD bounty.\n\nAdd support for project-specific team members.\n\nProblem: I have team members I want to add to a project on Coolify, but I don’t want to give them access to the full account and to all projects on the server. Instead, I want to invite them to a specific project on Coolify and for them to only have access to that project.\n\nAdditionally, I want to optionally allow the project-specific member to deploy their own apps on the servers on the account. This will just create a new project in the Team with them as a project-specific member.\n\nI should be able to manage all project-specific members from the main team page in addition to on each project’s page.\n\nAny APIs that exist for managing team members should also work for project-specific members.\n\nThe purpose of this bounty is to create a secure way to give people limited access to projects on Coolify. They must not be able to break out of their permissions. For example, if I can SSH into a server as a project member using one of the keys - that would allow me to break out of my permissions.\n\nAcceptance criteria: Once your PR is merged and deployed on Coolify Cloud, I will test the features and award the bounty.

Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",
