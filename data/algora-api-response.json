Instead, I want to invite them to a specific project on Coolify and for them to only have access to that project.\n\nAdditionally, I want to optionally allow the project-specific member to deploy their own apps on the servers on the account.

To support any size database we should investigate enhancements to allow any sized database to be exported. Currently the size limitations are 1GB for Durable Objects with 10GB in the future. Operate under the assumption that we might be attempting to dump a 10GB database into a `.sql` file.\n\nAnother consideration to make is because Durable Objects execute synchronous operations we may need to allow for \"breathing intervals\". An example might be we allow our export operation to run for 5 seconds, and take 5 seconds off if other requests are in a queue, then it can pick up again. The goal here would be to prevent locking the database for long periods of time.\n\nBut then poses the questions: \n1. How do we continue operations that need more than 30 seconds to work?\n2. Where is the data stored as it's being created? (R2, S3, something else)?\n3. How do we deliver that dump information to the user after its completed?\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Hit the `/export/dump` endpoint on a large database\n2. Will eventually fail when the 30 second request response time window closes\n\nRun the following command in Terminal (replace the URL with yours) and if your operation exceeds 30 seconds you should see a failed network response instead of a dump file.\n```\ncurl --location 'https://starbasedb.YOUR-ID-HERE.workers.dev/export/dump' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' \\\n--output database_dump.sql\n```\n\nIf you can't create a large enough test database feel free to add code in to `sleep` for 29 seconds before proceeding with the `/export/dump` functional code and should also see the failure.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nAs a user I would expect any and all of the specified data to be dumped out without an error and without partial results. Where it ends up for the user to access if the operation takes more than 30 seconds is up for discussion. Ideally if shorter than 30 seconds it could be returned as our cURL above works today (downloads the file from the response of the origin request), but perhaps after the timeout it continues on uploads it to a destination source to access afterwards?\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n1. For backups require an R2 binding\n2. Have a `.sql` file that gets created in R2 with the filename like `dump_20240101-170000.sql` where it represents `2024-01-01 17:00:00`\n3. Create the file and continuously append new chunks to it until reaching the end\n4. May need to utilize a DO alarm to continue the work after X time if a timeout occurs & mark where it currently is in the process in internal memory so it can pick up and continue.\n5. Provide a callback URL when the operation is finally completed so users can create custom logic to notify them (e.g. Email, Slack, etc)",

Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",

                  "body": "Hey, I've recently proposed something on Discord, and since feedback has been rather positive, I'm making a ticket to track the idea.\n\nI've been working with Queues recently, and I've been having some issues around `shutdown` that I would like to address.\n\nSpecifically, I find it a common pattern that I send some kind of request object through a queue because I want another fiber to perform some action on my behalf. Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",

              "body": "Hey, I've recently proposed something on Discord, and since feedback has been rather positive, I'm making a ticket to track the idea.\n\nI've been working with Queues recently, and I've been having some issues around `shutdown` that I would like to address.\n\nSpecifically, I find it a common pattern that I send some kind of request object through a queue because I want another fiber to perform some action on my behalf. Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",

This is making it so I can't use the integration.\r\n\r\nWe also use Fastmail and have been seeing some oddities with the [cal.com](http://cal.com/) integration. Namely, that participants are receiving multiple calendar invites, which on it's own isn't that big of a deal. However, the Fastmail invites are always in UTC, not in the local time of the cal.com invite.\r\n\r\nThis is creating a lot of confusion with participants, they keep missing our meetings, not realizing one invite is UTC and one in local time. I spoke with the Fastmail team and they relayed the following notes about cal's specific integration.\r\n\r\n1. There is a property (SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT) a CalDAV client can add to the event that would prevent CalDAV servers from sending invitations. It appears cal.com is not setting this property even though they are sending an invitation.\r\n2. The invitation being sent by [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is using a different UID. Basically every event has a UID that uniquely identifies the event. Since [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is sending the invitation of the event with a different UID, if you end up adding this event to your calendar [cal.com](http://cal.com/), it will create a duplicate event in your calendar as well. They need to fix it so that all emails associated with a single event use the same original UID.\r\n3. The event added from [cal.com](http://cal.com/) doesn't have a timezone associated with it. Though it mentions the invitees timezone as \"America/Chicago\" in the notes, the event itself doesn't include a timezone and only specifies the time in UTC. Since the event time is specified in UTC, Fastmail's invitation email will also be sent in UTC.\r\n4. There seems to be no way to stop Cal.com from creating the calendar events at all, and thus no real workaround.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Connect to Fastmail using CalDav integration\r\n2. Create a test booking\r\n3. See issues above.\r\n\r\nAny other relevant information. For example, why do you consider this a bug and what did you expect to happen instead?\r\n1. SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT should be set, so Fastmail knows not to send an invitation. **This is the main one.**\r\n2. UID should be unique per event.\r\n3. Event time should have a timezone associated with it.\r\n4. An option could be added to make calendar event creation optional (nice-to-have, not essential).\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\n\r\nNone other than Fastmail/CalDAV.",

I also looked into third-party integration tools, but they may not offer the same seamless experience and could incur additional costs.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nMaintaining a functional Pipedrive integration is crucial for users who rely on it to sync their scheduling with their CRM systems. The deprecation of Revert.dev has disrupted this workflow, impacting productivity. Updating the integration will restore this essential functionality for many users.\r\n\r\n### Requirement/Document\r\n\r\n- [Pipedrive API Authentication Documentation](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/core-api-concepts-authentication)\r\n",
