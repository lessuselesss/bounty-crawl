I’d like to propose adding the SparkFun MicroMod STM32 Processor to the funboards catalog.\n\n- Board: SparkFun MicroMod STM32 Processor (STM32F405RGT6)\n- Product page: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/21326\n- Hardware repo: https://github.com/sparkfun/MicroMod_STM32_Processor\n- Hookup guide: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/micromod-stm32-processor-hookup-guide\n- Schematic (PDF): https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/8/a/a/7/3/MicroMod_STM32_Processor.pdf\n\nWhy this board\n- Expands MicroMod coverage (M.2 “E-class” 22mm edge) and brings STM32F4 (Cortex-M4) into the catalog.\n- Reusable mapping: once the MicroMod edge connector + STM32F405 pins are modeled, other MicroMod processors benefit.\n- Complexity: moderate/advanced (MCU, HSE/LSE clocks, boot/reset gating, SPI flash, SDIO, USB, SWD). Seems like a mid-tier bounty candidate.\n\nDuplication check\n- I checked the public boards list in `tscircuit/sparkfun-boards/boards/` and did not find this board at time of filing.\n- Also glanced at the org project board (https://github.com/orgs/tscircuit/projects/6) and didn’t see it in progress. Please correct me if I missed it.\n\nPlanned implementation (TSX; no XY tooling)\n- Schematic (TSX):\n  - `STM32F405RG` (LQFP-64) with VDDx/VDDA/VSSA, `VCAP1/2` decoupling, `PH0/PH1` 12MHz HSE, `PC14/PC15` 32.768kHz LSE.\n  - SPI flash W25Qxx (WSON-8 6x5) on SPI1 (PA5/PA6/PA7) + `PC4` CS#; HOLD#/WP# as per schematic.\n  - MicroMod edge symbol with named pins: 3.3V, GNDs, `USB_D±`, `USB_VIN`, `RTC_3V`, `3.3V_EN`, `!RESET!`, `!BOOT!`, SWDIO/SWCLK, SDIO, SPI, I2C, UART, BUS/GPIO.\n  - Boot/reset: `BOOT0` gating via P‑MOSFET (DMG2305UX‑7), RC on `NRST`, `PB2` (BOOT1) strapped.\n- PCB (TSX):\n  - 22mm MicroMod card outline with chamfer; custom edge pad footprint (pads 1–75) per MicroMod spec.\n  - Place LQFP‑64, crystals (3225/3215), WSON‑8 flash, decoupling; indicative routing for visuals.\n- Artifacts: snapshots/renders via `tsci snapshot`.\n\nAcceptance/questions\n- Can you confirm it’s green to proceed and eligible for a bounty?

I’d like to propose adding the SparkFun MicroMod STM32 Processor to the funboards catalog.\n\n- Board: SparkFun MicroMod STM32 Processor (STM32F405RGT6)\n- Product page: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/21326\n- Hardware repo: https://github.com/sparkfun/MicroMod_STM32_Processor\n- Hookup guide: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/micromod-stm32-processor-hookup-guide\n- Schematic (PDF): https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/8/a/a/7/3/MicroMod_STM32_Processor.pdf\n\nWhy this board\n- Expands MicroMod coverage (M.2 “E-class” 22mm edge) and brings STM32F4 (Cortex-M4) into the catalog.\n- Reusable mapping: once the MicroMod edge connector + STM32F405 pins are modeled, other MicroMod processors benefit.\n- Complexity: moderate/advanced (MCU, HSE/LSE clocks, boot/reset gating, SPI flash, SDIO, USB, SWD). Seems like a mid-tier bounty candidate.\n\nDuplication check\n- I checked the public boards list in `tscircuit/sparkfun-boards/boards/` and did not find this board at time of filing.\n- Also glanced at the org project board (https://github.com/orgs/tscircuit/projects/6) and didn’t see it in progress.
