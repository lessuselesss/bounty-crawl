This type should mirror the existing <code>DynamicPatch</code> implementation, adapted for JSON's simpler data model.</p>\n<h2>Motivation</h2>\n<p><code>DynamicValue</code> has a well-designed <code>DynamicPatch</code> system with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monoid composition (<code>++</code> with <code>empty</code> identity)</li>\n<li>LCS-based sequence diffing</li>\n<li>Primitive delta operations (numeric deltas, string edits)</li>\n<li>Comprehensive algebraic laws verified by property tests</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposed <code>Json</code> type (see #TBD) needs equivalent patching capabilities. Rather than converting <code>Json ↔ DynamicValue</code> for every patch operation, a native <code>JsonPatch</code> provides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Type safety (no conversion errors for JSON-incompatible DynamicPatch operations)</li>\n<li>API consistency with the <code>Json</code> type</li>\n<li>Potential for JSON-specific optimizations</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Design Sketch</h2>\n<p>A design sketch is available at <a href=\"https://claude.ai/chat/schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala\"><code>schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala</code></a>. This sketch is <strong>a guide, not a specification</strong> — implementers should use judgment and deviate where appropriate.</p>\n<h3>Core Types</h3>\n<p>The design mirrors <code>DynamicPatch</code> with JSON-specific adaptations:</p>\n\nDynamicPatch | JsonPatch | Notes\n-- | -- | --\nDynamicPatch(Vector[DynamicPatchOp]) | JsonPatch(Vector[JsonPatchOp]) | Same structure\nOperation.Set | Op.Set | Same\nOperation.PrimitiveDelta | Op.PrimitiveDelta | Simplified for JSON types\nOperation.SequenceEdit | Op.ArrayEdit | Renamed\nOperation.MapEdit | Op.ObjectEdit | String keys only\nOperation.Patch | Op.Nested | Same\nSeqOp | ArrayOp | Same operations\nMapOp | ObjectOp | String keys only\nPrimitiveOp (14 variants) | PrimitiveOp (2 variants) | See below\n\n\n<h3>StringOp</h3>\n<p>Mirror

This type should mirror the existing `DynamicPatch` implementation, adapted for JSON's simpler data model.\n\n## Motivation\n\n`DynamicValue` has a well-designed `DynamicPatch` system with:\n- Monoid composition (`++` with `empty` identity)\n- LCS-based sequence diffing\n- Primitive delta operations (numeric deltas, string edits)\n- Comprehensive algebraic laws verified by property tests\n\nThe proposed `Json` type (see #TBD) needs equivalent patching capabilities. Rather than converting `Json ↔ DynamicValue` for every patch operation, a native `JsonPatch` provides:\n- Type safety (no conversion errors for JSON-incompatible DynamicPatch operations)\n- API consistency with the `Json` type\n- Potential for JSON-specific optimizations\n\n## Design Sketch\n\nA design sketch is available at [`[schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala](https://claude.ai/chat/schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala)`](./schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala). This sketch is **a guide, not a specification** — implementers should use judgment and deviate where appropriate.\n\n### Core Types\n\nThe design mirrors `DynamicPatch` with JSON-specific adaptations:\n\n| DynamicPatch | JsonPatch | Notes |\n|--------------|-----------|-------|\n| `DynamicPatch(Vector[DynamicPatchOp])` | `JsonPatch(Vector[JsonPatchOp])` | Same structure |\n| `Operation.Set` | `Op.Set` | Same |\n| `Operation.PrimitiveDelta` | `Op.PrimitiveDelta` | Simplified for JSON types |\n| `Operation.SequenceEdit` | `Op.ArrayEdit` | Renamed |\n| `Operation.MapEdit` | `Op.ObjectEdit` | String keys only |\n| `Operation.Patch` | `Op.Nested` | Same |\n| `SeqOp` | `ArrayOp` | Same operations |\n| `MapOp` | `ObjectOp` | String keys only |\n| `PrimitiveOp` (14 variants) | `PrimitiveOp` (2 variants) | See below |\n\n### Primitive Operations\n\nJSON has a simpler type system than `DynamicValue`:\n\n| JSON Type | Delta Operation | Notes |\n|-----------|-----------------|-------|\n| Number | `NumberDelta(BigDecimal)` | Unifies all numeric deltas |\n| String | `StringEdit(Vector[StringOp])` | Same as `DynamicPatch` |\n| Boolean | Use `Op.Set` | No delta (same as `DynamicPatch`) |\n| Null | Use `Op.Set` | No delta |\n\n### StringOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.StringOp` exactly:\n- `Insert(index: Int, text: String)`\n- `Delete(index: Int, length: Int)`\n- `Append(text: String)`\n- `Modify(index: Int, length: Int, text: String)`\n\n### ArrayOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.SeqOp`:\n- `Insert(index: Int, values: Vector[Json])`\n- `Append(values: Vector[Json])`\n- `Delete(index: Int, count: Int)`\n- `Modify(index: Int, op: Op)`\n\n### ObjectOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.MapOp` with string keys:\n- `Add(key: String, value: Json)`\n- `Remove(key: String)`\n- `Modify(key: String, patch: JsonPatch)`\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- [ ] **F1**: `JsonPatch.diff(source, target)` computes a patch transforming source to target\n- [ ] **F2**: `patch.apply(json, mode)` applies a patch with configurable failure handling\n- [ ] **F3**: `patch1 ++ patch2` composes patches (apply first, then second)\n- [ ] **F4**: `JsonPatch.empty` is the identity element for composition\n- [ ] **F5**: Support `JsonPatchMode.Strict`, `Lenient`, and `Clobber` modes\n- [ ] **F6**: Bidirectional conversion: `toDynamicPatch` / `fromDynamicPatch`\n\n### Algebraic Laws\n\nAll laws must be verified with property-based tests (see `PatchLawsSpec` for reference):\n\n- [ ] **L1**: Left identity — `(empty ++ p)(j) == p(j)`\n- [ ] **L2**: Right identity — `(p ++ empty)(j) == p(j)`\n- [ ] **L3**: Associativity — `((p1 ++ p2) ++ p3)(j) == (p1 ++ (p2 ++ p3))(j)`\n- [ ] **L4**: Roundtrip — `diff(a, b)(a) == Right(b)`\n- [ ] **L5**: Identity diff — `diff(j, j).isEmpty`\n- [ ] **L6**: Diff composition — `(diff(a, b) ++ diff(b, c))(a) == Right(c)`\n- [ ] **L7**: Lenient subsumes Strict — if `p(j, Strict) == Right(r)` then `p(j, Lenient) == Right(r)`\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- [ ] **T1**: Property-based tests for all algebraic laws (see `PatchLawsSpec`)\n- [ ] **T2**: Test each operation type (`Set`, `PrimitiveDelta`, `ArrayEdit`, `ObjectEdit`, `Nested`)\n- [ ] **T3**: Test each `ArrayOp` variant (`Insert`, `Append`, `Delete`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T4**: Test each `ObjectOp` variant (`Add`, `Remove`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T5**: Test each `StringOp` variant (`Insert`, `Delete`, `Append`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T6**: Test `NumberDelta` with positive, negative, zero, and decimal deltas\n- [ ] **T7**: Test all three `JsonPatchMode` behaviors\n- [ ] **T8**: Test `toDynamicPatch` / `fromDynamicPatch` roundtrip\n- [ ] **T9**: Test edge cases: empty arrays, empty objects, empty strings, nested structures\n- [ ] **T10**: Test error cases: invalid paths, type mismatches, out-of-bounds indices\n\n### Documentation Requirements\n\n- [ ] **D1**: ScalaDoc for all public types and methods\n- [ ] **D2**: Usage examples in ScalaDoc (see sketch for examples)\n- [ ] **D3**: Document algebraic laws in type-level comments\n- [ ] **D4**: Document relationship to `DynamicPatch`\n\n## Related\n\n-

This type should mirror the existing `DynamicPatch` implementation, adapted for JSON's simpler data model.\n\n## Motivation\n\n`DynamicValue` has a well-designed `DynamicPatch` system with:\n- Monoid composition (`++` with `empty` identity)\n- LCS-based sequence diffing\n- Primitive delta operations (numeric deltas, string edits)\n- Comprehensive algebraic laws verified by property tests\n\nThe proposed `Json` type (see #TBD) needs equivalent patching capabilities. Rather than converting `Json ↔ DynamicValue` for every patch operation, a native `JsonPatch` provides:\n- Type safety (no conversion errors for JSON-incompatible DynamicPatch operations)\n- API consistency with the `Json` type\n- Potential for JSON-specific optimizations\n\n## Design Sketch\n\nA design sketch is available at [`[schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala](https://claude.ai/chat/schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala)`](./schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala). This sketch is **a guide, not a specification** — implementers should use judgment and deviate where appropriate.\n\n### Core Types\n\nThe design mirrors `DynamicPatch` with JSON-specific adaptations:\n\n| DynamicPatch | JsonPatch | Notes |\n|--------------|-----------|-------|\n| `DynamicPatch(Vector[DynamicPatchOp])` | `JsonPatch(Vector[JsonPatchOp])` | Same structure |\n| `Operation.Set` | `Op.Set` | Same |\n| `Operation.PrimitiveDelta` | `Op.PrimitiveDelta` | Simplified for JSON types |\n| `Operation.SequenceEdit` | `Op.ArrayEdit` | Renamed |\n| `Operation.MapEdit` | `Op.ObjectEdit` | String keys only |\n| `Operation.Patch` | `Op.Nested` | Same |\n| `SeqOp` | `ArrayOp` | Same operations |\n| `MapOp` | `ObjectOp` | String keys only |\n| `PrimitiveOp` (14 variants) | `PrimitiveOp` (2 variants) | See below |\n\n### Primitive Operations\n\nJSON has a simpler type system than `DynamicValue`:\n\n| JSON Type | Delta Operation | Notes |\n|-----------|-----------------|-------|\n| Number | `NumberDelta(BigDecimal)` | Unifies all numeric deltas |\n| String | `StringEdit(Vector[StringOp])` | Same as `DynamicPatch` |\n| Boolean | Use `Op.Set` | No delta (same as `DynamicPatch`) |\n| Null | Use `Op.Set` | No delta |\n\n### StringOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.StringOp` exactly:\n- `Insert(index: Int, text: String)`\n- `Delete(index: Int, length: Int)`\n- `Append(text: String)`\n- `Modify(index: Int, length: Int, text: String)`\n\n### ArrayOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.SeqOp`:\n- `Insert(index: Int, values: Vector[Json])`\n- `Append(values: Vector[Json])`\n- `Delete(index: Int, count: Int)`\n- `Modify(index: Int, op: Op)`\n\n### ObjectOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.MapOp` with string keys:\n- `Add(key: String, value: Json)`\n- `Remove(key: String)`\n- `Modify(key: String, patch: JsonPatch)`\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- [ ] **F1**: `JsonPatch.diff(source, target)` computes a patch transforming source to target\n- [ ] **F2**: `patch.apply(json, mode)` applies a patch with configurable failure handling\n- [ ] **F3**: `patch1 ++ patch2` composes patches (apply first, then second)\n- [ ] **F4**: `JsonPatch.empty` is the identity element for composition\n- [ ] **F5**: Support `JsonPatchMode.Strict`, `Lenient`, and `Clobber` modes\n- [ ] **F6**: Bidirectional conversion: `toDynamicPatch` / `fromDynamicPatch`\n\n### Algebraic Laws\n\nAll laws must be verified with property-based tests (see `PatchLawsSpec` for reference):\n\n- [ ] **L1**: Left identity — `(empty ++ p)(j) == p(j)`\n- [ ] **L2**: Right identity — `(p ++ empty)(j) == p(j)`\n- [ ] **L3**: Associativity — `((p1 ++ p2) ++ p3)(j) == (p1 ++ (p2 ++ p3))(j)`\n- [ ] **L4**: Roundtrip — `diff(a, b)(a) == Right(b)`\n- [ ] **L5**: Identity diff — `diff(j, j).isEmpty`\n- [ ] **L6**: Diff composition — `(diff(a, b) ++ diff(b, c))(a) == Right(c)`\n- [ ] **L7**: Lenient subsumes Strict — if `p(j, Strict) == Right(r)` then `p(j, Lenient) == Right(r)`\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- [ ] **T1**: Property-based tests for all algebraic laws (see `PatchLawsSpec`)\n- [ ] **T2**: Test each operation type (`Set`, `PrimitiveDelta`, `ArrayEdit`, `ObjectEdit`, `Nested`)\n- [ ] **T3**: Test each `ArrayOp` variant (`Insert`, `Append`, `Delete`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T4**: Test each `ObjectOp` variant (`Add`, `Remove`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T5**: Test each `StringOp` variant (`Insert`, `Delete`, `Append`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T6**: Test `NumberDelta` with positive, negative, zero, and decimal deltas\n- [ ]

This allows for duck-typed schema validation and conversion between nominal and structural representations.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Direct Structural Schema Derivation\n\nSchemas can be derived directly for structural types:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 3\ntype Person = { def name: String; def age: Int }\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\n\n// Scala 2\ntype Person = { def name: String; def age: Int }\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\n```\n\n**Note**: Both Scala 2 and Scala 3 use `def` for uniformity, even though Scala 3 supports `val` in structural types.\n\n**Implementation**: Schemas have bindings, which allow construction / deconstruction of values. Values for structural types are backed by:\n- **Scala 3**: `Selectable` \n- **Scala 2**: `Dynamic`\n\n### Nominal to Structural Conversion\n\nConvert nominal type schemas to their structural equivalents:\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Get the structural schema corresponding to Person's shape\nval structuralSchema: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Schema.derived[Person].structural\n```\n\n### Schema API Extension\n\n```scala\ncase class Schema[A](/* existing fields */) {\n  /**\n   * Convert this schema to a structural type schema.\n   * \n   * The structural type represents the \"shape\" of A without its nominal identity.\n   * This enables duck typing and structural validation.\n   * \n   * @param toStructural Macro-generated conversion to structural representation\n   * @return Schema for the structural type corresponding to A\n   */\n  def structural(implicit toStructural: ToStructural[A]): Schema[toStructural.StructuralType] = \n    toStructural.apply(this)\n}\n\n/**\n * Type class for converting nominal schemas to structural schemas.\n * Generated by macro for all supported types. Macro fails if a structural\n * type cannot be generated.\n *\n * NOTE: This approach has to be tested to yield inferrable types, and revised\n * if necessary. Inferrable types (from calling Schema#structural) are a must-have.\n */\ntrait ToStructural[A] {\n  type StructuralType\n  def apply(schema: Schema[A]): Schema[StructuralType]\n}\n\nobject ToStructural {\n  type Aux[A, S] = ToStructural[A] { type StructuralType = S }\n  \n  // Scala 3\n  transparent inline given [A]: ToStructural[A] = ${toStructuralMacro[A]}\n  \n  // Scala 2\n  implicit def materialize[A]: ToStructural[A] = macro toStructuralImpl[A]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n### 1. Simple Product Types\n\n#### Case Class to Structural\n\n```scala\n// Both Scala 2 and Scala 3\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Original nominal schema\nval nominalSchema: Schema[Person] = Schema.derived[Person]\n\n// Convert to structural\nval structuralSchema: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  nominalSchema.structural\n\n// Direct structural derivation (equivalent)\nval directStructural: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Schema.derived[{ def name: String; def age: Int }]\n```\n\n### 2. Nested Structures\n\n```scala\ncase class Address(street: String, city: String, zip: Int)\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int, address: Address)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ \n//   def name: String\n//   def age: Int\n//   def address: { def street: String; def city: String; def zip: Int }\n// }]\n```\n\n### 3. Collections and Options\n\n```scala\ncase class Team(name: String, members: List[String], leader: Option[String])\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Team].structural\n// Type: Schema[{\n//   def name: String\n//   def members: List[String]\n//   def leader: Option[String]\n// }]\n```\n\n### 4. Tuples to Structural\n\n```scala\n// Tuples can be converted to structural types\nval tupleSchema: Schema[(String, Int, Boolean)] = Schema.derived[(String, Int, Boolean)]\n\nval structuralSchema = tupleSchema.structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def _1: String; def _2: Int; def _3: Boolean }]\n```\n\n### 5. Sum Types (Sealed Traits) - Scala 3 Only\n\nSealed traits become union types of structural representations, with tag information stored at the type level:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 3 only\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Result].structural\n// Type: Schema[\n//   { type Tag = \"Success\"; def value: Int } | { type Tag = \"Failure\"; def error: String }\n// ]\n```\n\n**Note**: Sum type to structural conversion is **not supported in Scala 2** because it requires union types. Attempting to call `.structural` on a sealed trait schema in Scala 2 will result in a compile-time error.\n\n### 6. Enums (Scala 3 Only)\n\n```scala\nenum Status:\n  case Active, Inactive, Suspended\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Status].structural\n// Type: Schema[{type Tag = \"Active\"} | {type Tag = \"Inactive\"} | {type Tag = \"Suspended\"}]\n```\n\n### 7. Opaque Types (Scala 3)\n\n```scala\nopaque type UserId = String\nobject UserId:\n  def apply(value: String): Either[String, UserId] = \n    if value.nonEmpty then Right(value) else Left(\"Empty user ID\")\n\ncase class User(id: UserId, name: String)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[User].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def id: String; def name: String }]\n// Opaque type is unwrapped to its underlying type\n```\n\n### 8. Bidirectional Conversion\n\nStructural schemas work seamlessly with `Into`/`As` (if this ticket is implemented **after** that ticket):\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n\n// Create structural value (Scala 3)\nval structuralPerson = new Selectable {\n  def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n    case \"name\" => \"Alice\"\n    case \"age\" => 30\n  }\n}\n\n// Convert structural to nominal using Into\nval person: Either[SchemaError, Person] = \n  Into[{ def name: String; def age: Int }, Person].into(structuralPerson)\n// => Right(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n\n// Convert nominal to structural\nval backToStructural: Either[SchemaError, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Into[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }].into(Person(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n### 9. Empty and Single-Field Products\n\n```scala\n// Empty case class\ncase class Empty()\nval emptyStructural = Schema.derived[Empty].structural\n// Type: Schema[{}]\n\n// Single field\ncase class Id(value: String)\nval idStructural = Schema.derived[Id].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def value: String }]\n```\n\n### 10. Large Products\n\n```scala\ncase class LargeRecord(\n  f1: String, f2: Int, f3: Boolean, f4: Double, f5: Long,\n  f6: String, f7: Int, f8: Boolean, f9: Double, f10: Long,\n  f11: String, f12: Int, f13: Boolean, f14: Double, f15: Long,\n  f16: String, f17: Int, f18: Boolean, f19: Double, f20: Long,\n  f21: String\n)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[LargeRecord].structural\n// Type: Schema[{\n//   def f1: String; def f2: Int; def f3: Boolean; ...\n//   def f21: String\n// }]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Type Name Handling\n\n### Current Limitation\n\nSchemas currently use `TypeName[A]` to identify types. Structural types don't have meaningful nominal type names, which creates a mismatch.\n\n### Temporary Solution\n\nUntil `TypeName[A]` is replaced with `TypeId[A]` (see issue #471), structural schemas will use a normalized string representation of the structural type as a fake type name:\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\nschema.typeName // => TypeName for \"Person\"\n\nval structural = schema.structural\nstructural.typeName // => TypeName for \"{age:Int,name:String}\"\n// Normalized: fields sorted alphabetically, types fully qualified\n```\n\n### Normalization Rules\n\n1. **Field ordering**: Alphabetical by field name\n2. **Type qualification**: Use simple names for primitives and standard library types\n3. **Whitespace**: No whitespace in generated names\n4. **Collections**: Standard notation (e.g., `List[Int]`)\n5. **Options**: Explicit `Option[T]` notation\n6. **Nested structures**: Recursive application of rules\n7. **Deterministic**: Same structure always produces same normalized name\n\n### Examples\n\n```scala\n// Simple product\ncase class Point(x: Int, y: Int)\nSchema.derived[Point].structural.typeName \n// => \"{x:Int,y:Int}\"\n\n// Nested product\ncase class Address(street: String, zip: Int)\ncase class Person(name: String, address: Address)\nSchema.derived[Person].structural.typeName\n// => \"{address:{street:String,zip:Int},name:String}\"\n\n// With collections\ncase class Team(name: String, members: List[String])\nSchema.derived[Team].structural.typeName\n// => \"{members:List[String],name:String}\"\n\n// Union type (Scala 3)\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\nSchema.derived[Result].structural.typeName\n// => \"{error:String}|{value:Int}\"\n```\n\n### Future: TypeId[A]\n\nThe upcoming `TypeId[A]` replacement will properly handle structural types by representing them by their structure rather than a string-based hack. See issue #471 for details.\n\n---\n\n## Limitations and Edge Cases\n\n### 1. Generic Types\n\n**Behavior depends on existing Schema derivation support for generic types.**\n\nIf `Schema.derived[Container[Int]]` already works, then structural conversion should work:\n\n```scala\ncase class Container[T](value: T)\n\n// If this works:\nval schema = Schema.derived[Container[Int]]\n\n// Then this should work:\nval structural = schema.structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def value: Int }]\n```\n\nIf generic type derivation is not currently supported, this ticket **does not require implementing it**. The macro should produce a clear compile-time error for unsupported generic types.\n\n### 2. Recursive Types\n\nRecursive types will **fail at compile-time** because Scala does not support infinite types:\n\n```scala\ncase class Tree(value: Int, children: List[Tree])\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time:\nval structural = Schema.derived[Tree].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate infinite structural type\n\n// The structural type would need to be:\n// { def value: Int; def children: List[{ def value: Int; def children: List[...] }] }\n// which is infinite and unsupported\n```\n\nThe macro must detect recursive types and produce a helpful error message:\n\n```\nCompile error: Cannot generate structural type for recursive type Tree.\nStructural types cannot represent recursive structures.\n```\n\n### 3. Mutually Recursive Types\n\nSimilarly, mutually recursive types are unsupported:\n\n```scala\ncase class Node(id: Int, edges: List[Edge])\ncase class Edge(from: Int, to: Node)\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time:\nval nodeStructural = Schema.derived[Node].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate structural type for mutually recursive types\n```\n\n### 4. Sum Types in Scala 2\n\nSealed traits and sum types **cannot be converted to structural types in Scala 2** because they require union types:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 2\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time in Scala 2:\nval structural = Schema.derived[Result].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate structural type for sum types in Scala 2.\n// Union types are required, which are only available in Scala 3.\n```\n\nThe macro must detect sum types in Scala 2 and produce a clear error.\n\n### 5. Case Objects\n\nCase objects become empty structural types:\n\n```scala\ncase object Singleton\n\nval structural = Schema.derived[Singleton.type].structural\n// Type: Schema[{}]\n```\n\nFor sum types with case objects (Scala 3):\n\n```scala\nsealed trait Status\ncase object Active extends Status\ncase object Inactive extends Status\n\nval structural = Schema.derived[Status].structural\n// Type: Schema[{} | {}]\n// Not particularly useful, but valid\n```\n\n### 6. Structural Types as Source\n\nDeriving schemas directly for structural types is supported:\n\n```scala\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\nval schema = Schema.derived[PersonStructure]\n// Should work if structural type derivation is implemented\n```\n\nThe schema's bindings will use `Selectable` (Scala 3) or `Dynamic` (Scala 2) to construct and deconstruct values.\n\n---\n\n## Integration with Into/As\n\nStructural schemas compose naturally with `Into`/`As` conversions.\n\n### Nominal → Structural\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Auto-derived conversion\nval nominalToStructural: Into[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Into.derived\n\nval person = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\nval structural = nominalToStructural.into(person)\n// => Right(<Selectable/Dynamic instance>)\n```\n\n### Structural → Nominal\n\n```scala\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Auto-derived conversion\nval structuralToNominal: Into[PersonStructure, Person] = \n  Into.derived\n\nval structural: PersonStructure = new Selectable {\n  def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n    case \"name\" => \"Bob\"\n    case \"age\" => 25\n  }\n}\n\nval person = structuralToNominal.into(structural)\n// => Right(Person(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n### Bidirectional (As)\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Bidirectional conversion\nval personAs: As[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  As.derived\n\n// Nominal → Structural\nval structural = personAs.into(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n\n// Structural → Nominal\nval nominal = structural.flatMap(personAs.from)\n// Round-trip successful\n```\n\n### Schema-Guided Conversion\n\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(firstName: String, lastName: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Use structural type as intermediary\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\n// Step 1: Transform V1 to structural (custom logic)\nval v1ToStructural: Into[PersonV1, PersonStructure] = \n  new Into[PersonV1, PersonStructure] {\n    def into(v1: PersonV1): Either[SchemaError, PersonStructure] = {\n      Right(new Selectable {\n        def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n          case \"name\" => s\"${v1.firstName} ${v1.lastName}\"\n          case \"age\" => v1.age\n        }\n      })\n    }\n  }\n\n// Step 2: Auto-convert structural to V2\nval structuralToV2: Into[PersonStructure, PersonV2] = Into.derived\n\n// Composed migration\ndef migrate(v1: PersonV1): Either[SchemaError, PersonV2] = {\n  v1ToStructural.into(v1).flatMap(structuralToV2.into)\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Matrix\n\n1. **Direct Structural Derivation**\n   - Simple products (case classes)\n   - Nested products\n   - Collections (List, Vector, Set, Map, Option, Either)\n   - Tuples (2-22 elements)\n   - Empty case classes\n   - Single-field case classes\n   - Large products (20+ fields)\n   - Case objects\n\n2. **Nominal to Structural Conversion**\n   - Case class → structural\n   - Tuple → structural\n   - Nested case classes → nested structural\n   - Case class with collections → structural with collections\n   - Empty case class → empty structural\n\n3. **Sum Types (Scala 3 Only)**\n   - Sealed trait → union type structural\n   - Sealed trait with case objects\n   - Enum → union type structural\n   - Nested sum types\n\n4. **Type Name Generation**\n   - Simple product normalized name\n   - Nested product normalized name\n   - Name determinism (same structure = same name)\n   - Alphabetical field ordering in names\n   - Union type names (Scala 3)\n\n5. **Selectable/Dynamic Implementation**\n   - Scala 3 Selectable field access\n   - Scala 2 Dynamic field access\n   - Field access correctness\n   - Missing field behavior\n   - Extra field behavior\n\n6. **Integration with Into/As**\n   - Nominal → Structural via Into\n   - Structural → Nominal via Into\n   - Round-trip via As\n   - Composed conversions with structural intermediary\n\n7. **Error Cases (Compile-Time)**\n   - Recursive types produce error\n   - Mutually recursive types produce error\n   - Sum types in Scala 2 produce error\n   - Unsupported types produce helpful errors\n\n8. **Generic Types** (if supported by existing Schema derivation)\n   - Fully applied generic → structural\n   - Generic with nested structural fields\n\n### Scala 2 vs Scala 3 Test Separation\n\n```\nsrc/test/scala/\n  structural/\n    common/\n      SimpleProductSpec.scala\n      NestedProductSpec.scala\n      CollectionsSpec.scala\n      TuplesSpec.scala\n      EmptyProductSpec.scala\n      SingleFieldSpec.scala\n      LargeProductSpec.scala\n      TypeNameNormalizationSpec.scala\n      IntoIntegrationSpec.scala\n      AsIntegrationSpec.scala\n      \n    scala3/\n      UnionTypesSpec.scala\n      SealedTraitToUnionSpec.scala\n      EnumToUnionSpec.scala\n      SelectableImplementationSpec.scala\n      \n    scala2/\n      DynamicImplementationSpec.scala\n      SumTypeErrorSpec.scala (verifies compile error)\n      \n    errors/\n      RecursiveTypeErrorSpec.scala\n      MutualRecursionErrorSpec.scala\n      UnsupportedTypeErrorSpec.scala\n```\n\n### Test Examples\n\n```scala\n// Test: Simple product to structural\ntest(\"case class converts to structural schema\") {\n  case class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n  \n  val structural = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n  \n  // Type check (this is a compile-time test)\n  val _: Schema[{ def name: String;

              "body": "# Structural Type Schema Support\n\n## Overview\n\nExtend `Schema[A]` to support structural types, enabling schema derivation for types defined by their structure rather than their nominal identity. This allows for duck-typed schema validation and conversion between nominal and structural representations.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Direct Structural Schema Derivation\n\nSchemas can be derived directly for structural types:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 3\ntype Person = { def name: String; def age: Int }\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\n\n// Scala 2\ntype Person = { def name: String; def age: Int }\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\n```\n\n**Note**: Both Scala 2 and Scala 3 use `def` for uniformity, even though Scala 3 supports `val` in structural types.\n\n**Implementation**: Schemas have bindings, which allow construction / deconstruction of values. Values for structural types are backed by:\n- **Scala 3**: `Selectable` \n- **Scala 2**: `Dynamic`\n\n### Nominal to Structural Conversion\n\nConvert nominal type schemas to their structural equivalents:\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Get the structural schema corresponding to Person's shape\nval structuralSchema: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Schema.derived[Person].structural\n```\n\n### Schema API Extension\n\n```scala\ncase class Schema[A](/* existing fields */) {\n  /**\n   * Convert this schema to a structural type schema.\n   * \n   * The structural type represents the \"shape\" of A without its nominal identity.\n   * This enables duck typing and structural validation.\n   * \n   * @param toStructural Macro-generated conversion to structural representation\n   * @return Schema for the structural type corresponding to A\n   */\n  def structural(implicit toStructural: ToStructural[A]): Schema[toStructural.StructuralType] = \n    toStructural.apply(this)\n}\n\n/**\n * Type class for converting nominal schemas to structural schemas.\n * Generated by macro for all supported types. Macro fails if a structural\n * type cannot be generated.\n *\n * NOTE: This approach has to be tested to yield inferrable types, and revised\n * if necessary. Inferrable types (from calling Schema#structural) are a must-have.\n */\ntrait ToStructural[A] {\n  type StructuralType\n  def apply(schema: Schema[A]): Schema[StructuralType]\n}\n\nobject ToStructural {\n  type Aux[A, S] = ToStructural[A] { type StructuralType = S }\n  \n  // Scala 3\n  transparent inline given [A]: ToStructural[A] = ${toStructuralMacro[A]}\n  \n  // Scala 2\n  implicit def materialize[A]: ToStructural[A] = macro toStructuralImpl[A]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n### 1. Simple Product Types\n\n#### Case Class to Structural\n\n```scala\n// Both Scala 2 and Scala 3\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Original nominal schema\nval nominalSchema: Schema[Person] = Schema.derived[Person]\n\n// Convert to structural\nval structuralSchema: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  nominalSchema.structural\n\n// Direct structural derivation (equivalent)\nval directStructural: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Schema.derived[{ def name: String; def age: Int }]\n```\n\n### 2. Nested Structures\n\n```scala\ncase class Address(street: String, city: String, zip: Int)\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int, address: Address)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ \n//   def name: String\n//   def age: Int\n//   def address: { def street: String; def city: String; def zip: Int }\n// }]\n```\n\n### 3. Collections and Options\n\n```scala\ncase class Team(name: String, members: List[String], leader: Option[String])\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Team].structural\n// Type: Schema[{\n//   def name: String\n//   def members: List[String]\n//   def leader: Option[String]\n// }]\n```\n\n### 4. Tuples to Structural\n\n```scala\n// Tuples can be converted to structural types\nval tupleSchema: Schema[(String, Int, Boolean)] = Schema.derived[(String, Int, Boolean)]\n\nval structuralSchema = tupleSchema.structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def _1: String; def _2: Int; def _3: Boolean }]\n```\n\n### 5. Sum Types (Sealed Traits) - Scala 3 Only\n\nSealed traits become union types of structural representations, with tag information stored at the type level:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 3 only\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Result].structural\n// Type: Schema[\n//   { type Tag = \"Success\"; def value: Int } | { type Tag = \"Failure\"; def error: String }\n// ]\n```\n\n**Note**: Sum type to structural conversion is **not supported in Scala 2** because it requires union types. Attempting to call `.structural` on a sealed trait schema in Scala 2 will result in a compile-time error.\n\n### 6. Enums (Scala 3 Only)\n\n```scala\nenum Status:\n  case Active, Inactive, Suspended\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Status].structural\n// Type: Schema[{type Tag = \"Active\"} | {type Tag = \"Inactive\"} | {type Tag = \"Suspended\"}]\n```\n\n### 7. Opaque Types (Scala 3)\n\n```scala\nopaque type UserId = String\nobject UserId:\n  def apply(value: String): Either[String, UserId] = \n    if value.nonEmpty then Right(value) else Left(\"Empty user ID\")\n\ncase class User(id: UserId, name: String)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[User].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def id: String; def name: String }]\n// Opaque type is unwrapped to its underlying type\n```\n\n### 8. Bidirectional Conversion\n\nStructural schemas work seamlessly with `Into`/`As` (if this ticket is implemented **after** that ticket):\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n\n// Create structural value (Scala 3)\nval structuralPerson = new Selectable {\n  def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n    case \"name\" => \"Alice\"\n    case \"age\" => 30\n  }\n}\n\n// Convert structural to nominal using Into\nval person: Either[SchemaError, Person] = \n  Into[{ def name: String; def age: Int }, Person].into(structuralPerson)\n// => Right(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n\n// Convert nominal to structural\nval backToStructural: Either[SchemaError, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Into[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }].into(Person(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n### 9. Empty and Single-Field Products\n\n```scala\n// Empty case class\ncase class Empty()\nval emptyStructural = Schema.derived[Empty].structural\n// Type: Schema[{}]\n\n// Single field\ncase class Id(value: String)\nval idStructural = Schema.derived[Id].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def value: String }]\n```\n\n### 10. Large Products\n\n```scala\ncase class LargeRecord(\n  f1: String, f2: Int, f3: Boolean, f4: Double, f5: Long,\n  f6: String, f7: Int, f8: Boolean, f9: Double, f10: Long,\n  f11: String, f12: Int, f13: Boolean, f14: Double, f15: Long,\n  f16: String, f17: Int, f18: Boolean, f19: Double, f20: Long,\n  f21: String\n)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[LargeRecord].structural\n// Type: Schema[{\n//   def f1: String; def f2: Int; def f3: Boolean; ...\n//   def f21: String\n// }]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Type Name Handling\n\n### Current Limitation\n\nSchemas currently use `TypeName[A]` to identify types. Structural types don't have meaningful nominal type names, which creates a mismatch.\n\n### Temporary Solution\n\nUntil `TypeName[A]` is replaced with `TypeId[A]` (see issue #471), structural schemas will use a normalized string representation of the structural type as a fake type name:\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\nschema.typeName // => TypeName for \"Person\"\n\nval structural = schema.structural\nstructural.typeName // => TypeName for \"{age:Int,name:String}\"\n// Normalized: fields sorted alphabetically, types fully qualified\n```\n\n### Normalization Rules\n\n1. **Field ordering**: Alphabetical by field name\n2. **Type qualification**: Use simple names for primitives and standard library types\n3. **Whitespace**: No whitespace in generated names\n4. **Collections**: Standard notation (e.g., `List[Int]`)\n5. **Options**: Explicit `Option[T]` notation\n6. **Nested structures**: Recursive application of rules\n7. **Deterministic**: Same structure always produces same normalized name\n\n### Examples\n\n```scala\n// Simple product\ncase class Point(x: Int, y: Int)\nSchema.derived[Point].structural.typeName \n// => \"{x:Int,y:Int}\"\n\n// Nested product\ncase class Address(street: String, zip: Int)\ncase class Person(name: String, address: Address)\nSchema.derived[Person].structural.typeName\n// => \"{address:{street:String,zip:Int},name:String}\"\n\n// With collections\ncase class Team(name: String, members: List[String])\nSchema.derived[Team].structural.typeName\n// => \"{members:List[String],name:String}\"\n\n// Union type (Scala 3)\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\nSchema.derived[Result].structural.typeName\n// => \"{error:String}|{value:Int}\"\n```\n\n### Future: TypeId[A]\n\nThe upcoming `TypeId[A]` replacement will properly handle structural types by representing them by their structure rather than a string-based hack. See issue #471 for details.\n\n---\n\n## Limitations and Edge Cases\n\n### 1. Generic Types\n\n**Behavior depends on existing Schema derivation support for generic types.**\n\nIf `Schema.derived[Container[Int]]` already works, then structural conversion should work:\n\n```scala\ncase class Container[T](value: T)\n\n// If this works:\nval schema = Schema.derived[Container[Int]]\n\n// Then this should work:\nval structural = schema.structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def value: Int }]\n```\n\nIf generic type derivation is not currently supported, this ticket **does not require implementing it**. The macro should produce a clear compile-time error for unsupported generic types.\n\n### 2. Recursive Types\n\nRecursive types will **fail at compile-time** because Scala does not support infinite types:\n\n```scala\ncase class Tree(value: Int, children: List[Tree])\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time:\nval structural = Schema.derived[Tree].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate infinite structural type\n\n// The structural type would need to be:\n// { def value: Int; def children: List[{ def value: Int; def children: List[...] }] }\n// which is infinite and unsupported\n```\n\nThe macro must detect recursive types and produce a helpful error message:\n\n```\nCompile error: Cannot generate structural type for recursive type Tree.\nStructural types cannot represent recursive structures.\n```\n\n### 3. Mutually Recursive Types\n\nSimilarly, mutually recursive types are unsupported:\n\n```scala\ncase class Node(id: Int, edges: List[Edge])\ncase class Edge(from: Int, to: Node)\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time:\nval nodeStructural = Schema.derived[Node].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate structural type for mutually recursive types\n```\n\n### 4. Sum Types in Scala 2\n\nSealed traits and sum types **cannot be converted to structural types in Scala 2** because they require union types:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 2\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time in Scala 2:\nval structural = Schema.derived[Result].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate structural type for sum types in Scala 2.\n// Union types are required, which are only available in Scala 3.\n```\n\nThe macro must detect sum types in Scala 2 and produce a clear error.\n\n### 5. Case Objects\n\nCase objects become empty structural types:\n\n```scala\ncase object Singleton\n\nval structural = Schema.derived[Singleton.type].structural\n// Type: Schema[{}]\n```\n\nFor sum types with case objects (Scala 3):\n\n```scala\nsealed trait Status\ncase object Active extends Status\ncase object Inactive extends Status\n\nval structural = Schema.derived[Status].structural\n// Type: Schema[{} | {}]\n// Not particularly useful, but valid\n```\n\n### 6. Structural Types as Source\n\nDeriving schemas directly for structural types is supported:\n\n```scala\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\nval schema = Schema.derived[PersonStructure]\n// Should work if structural type derivation is implemented\n```\n\nThe schema's bindings will use `Selectable` (Scala 3) or `Dynamic` (Scala 2) to construct and deconstruct values.\n\n---\n\n## Integration with Into/As\n\nStructural schemas compose naturally with `Into`/`As` conversions.\n\n### Nominal → Structural\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Auto-derived conversion\nval nominalToStructural: Into[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Into.derived\n\nval person = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\nval structural = nominalToStructural.into(person)\n// => Right(<Selectable/Dynamic instance>)\n```\n\n### Structural → Nominal\n\n```scala\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Auto-derived conversion\nval structuralToNominal: Into[PersonStructure, Person] = \n  Into.derived\n\nval structural: PersonStructure = new Selectable {\n  def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n    case \"name\" => \"Bob\"\n    case \"age\" => 25\n  }\n}\n\nval person = structuralToNominal.into(structural)\n// => Right(Person(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n### Bidirectional (As)\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Bidirectional conversion\nval personAs: As[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  As.derived\n\n// Nominal → Structural\nval structural = personAs.into(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n\n// Structural → Nominal\nval nominal = structural.flatMap(personAs.from)\n// Round-trip successful\n```\n\n### Schema-Guided Conversion\n\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(firstName: String, lastName: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Use structural type as intermediary\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\n// Step 1: Transform V1 to structural (custom logic)\nval v1ToStructural: Into[PersonV1, PersonStructure] = \n  new Into[PersonV1, PersonStructure] {\n    def into(v1: PersonV1): Either[SchemaError, PersonStructure] = {\n      Right(new Selectable {\n        def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n          case \"name\" => s\"${v1.firstName} ${v1.lastName}\"\n          case \"age\" => v1.age\n        }\n      })\n    }\n  }\n\n// Step 2: Auto-convert structural to V2\nval structuralToV2: Into[PersonStructure, PersonV2] = Into.derived\n\n// Composed migration\ndef migrate(v1: PersonV1): Either[SchemaError, PersonV2] = {\n  v1ToStructural.into(v1).flatMap(structuralToV2.into)\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Matrix\n\n1. **Direct Structural Derivation**\n   - Simple products (case classes)\n   - Nested products\n   - Collections (List, Vector, Set, Map, Option, Either)\n   - Tuples (2-22 elements)\n   - Empty case classes\n   - Single-field case classes\n   - Large products (20+ fields)\n   - Case objects\n\n2. **Nominal to Structural Conversion**\n   - Case class → structural\n   - Tuple → structural\n   - Nested case classes → nested structural\n   - Case class with collections → structural with collections\n   - Empty case class → empty structural\n\n3. **Sum Types (Scala 3 Only)**\n   - Sealed trait → union type structural\n   - Sealed trait with case objects\n   - Enum → union type structural\n   - Nested sum types\n\n4. **Type Name Generation**\n   - Simple product normalized name\n   - Nested product normalized name\n   - Name determinism (same structure = same name)\n   - Alphabetical field ordering in names\n   - Union type names (Scala 3)\n\n5. **Selectable/Dynamic Implementation**\n   - Scala 3 Selectable field access\n   - Scala 2 Dynamic field access\n   - Field access correctness\n   - Missing field behavior\n   - Extra field behavior\n\n6. **Integration with Into/As**\n   - Nominal → Structural via Into\n   - Structural → Nominal via Into\n   - Round-trip via As\n   - Composed conversions with structural intermediary\n\n7. **Error Cases (Compile-Time)**\n   - Recursive types produce error\n   - Mutually recursive types produce error\n   - Sum types in Scala 2 produce error\n   - Unsupported types produce helpful errors\n\n8. **Generic Types** (if supported by existing Schema derivation)\n   - Fully applied generic → structural\n   - Generic with nested structural fields\n\n### Scala 2 vs Scala 3 Test Separation\n\n```\nsrc/test/scala/\n  structural/\n    common/\n      SimpleProductSpec.scala\n      NestedProductSpec.scala\n      CollectionsSpec.scala\n      TuplesSpec.scala\n      EmptyProductSpec.scala\n      SingleFieldSpec.scala\n      LargeProductSpec.scala\n      TypeNameNormalizationSpec.scala\n      IntoIntegrationSpec.scala\n      AsIntegrationSpec.scala\n      \n    scala3/\n      UnionTypesSpec.scala\n      SealedTraitToUnionSpec.scala\n      EnumToUnionSpec.scala\n      SelectableImplementationSpec.scala\n      \n    scala2/\n      DynamicImplementationSpec.scala\n      SumTypeErrorSpec.scala (verifies compile error)\n      \n    errors/\n      RecursiveTypeErrorSpec.scala\n      MutualRecursionErrorSpec.scala\n      UnsupportedTypeErrorSpec.scala\n```\n\n### Test Examples\n\n```scala\n// Test: Simple product to structural\ntest(\"case class converts to structural schema\") {\n  case class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n  \n  val structural = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n  \n  // Type check (this is a compile-time test)\n  val _: Schema[{ def name: String;

This type should mirror the existing `DynamicPatch` implementation, adapted for JSON's simpler data model.\n\n## Motivation\n\n`DynamicValue` has a well-designed `DynamicPatch` system with:\n- Monoid composition (`++` with `empty` identity)\n- LCS-based sequence diffing\n- Primitive delta operations (numeric deltas, string edits)\n- Comprehensive algebraic laws verified by property tests\n\nThe proposed `Json` type (see #TBD) needs equivalent patching capabilities. Rather than converting `Json ↔ DynamicValue` for every patch operation, a native `JsonPatch` provides:\n- Type safety (no conversion errors for JSON-incompatible DynamicPatch operations)\n- API consistency with the `Json` type\n- Potential for JSON-specific optimizations\n\n## Design Sketch\n\nA design sketch is available at [`[schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala](https://claude.ai/chat/schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala)`](./schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala). This sketch is **a guide, not a specification** — implementers should use judgment and deviate where appropriate.\n\n### Core Types\n\nThe design mirrors `DynamicPatch` with JSON-specific adaptations:\n\n| DynamicPatch | JsonPatch | Notes |\n|--------------|-----------|-------|\n| `DynamicPatch(Vector[DynamicPatchOp])` | `JsonPatch(Vector[JsonPatchOp])` | Same structure |\n| `Operation.Set` | `Op.Set` | Same |\n| `Operation.PrimitiveDelta` | `Op.PrimitiveDelta` | Simplified for JSON types |\n| `Operation.SequenceEdit` | `Op.ArrayEdit` | Renamed |\n| `Operation.MapEdit` | `Op.ObjectEdit` | String keys only |\n| `Operation.Patch` | `Op.Nested` | Same |\n| `SeqOp` | `ArrayOp` | Same operations |\n| `MapOp` | `ObjectOp` | String keys only |\n| `PrimitiveOp` (14 variants) | `PrimitiveOp` (2 variants) | See below |\n\n### Primitive Operations\n\nJSON has a simpler type system than `DynamicValue`:\n\n| JSON Type | Delta Operation | Notes |\n|-----------|-----------------|-------|\n| Number | `NumberDelta(BigDecimal)` | Unifies all numeric deltas |\n| String | `StringEdit(Vector[StringOp])` | Same as `DynamicPatch` |\n| Boolean | Use `Op.Set` | No delta (same as `DynamicPatch`) |\n| Null | Use `Op.Set` | No delta |\n\n### StringOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.StringOp` exactly:\n- `Insert(index: Int, text: String)`\n- `Delete(index: Int, length: Int)`\n- `Append(text: String)`\n- `Modify(index: Int, length: Int, text: String)`\n\n### ArrayOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.SeqOp`:\n- `Insert(index: Int, values: Vector[Json])`\n- `Append(values: Vector[Json])`\n- `Delete(index: Int, count: Int)`\n- `Modify(index: Int, op: Op)`\n\n### ObjectOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.MapOp` with string keys:\n- `Add(key: String, value: Json)`\n- `Remove(key: String)`\n- `Modify(key: String, patch: JsonPatch)`\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- [ ] **F1**: `JsonPatch.diff(source, target)` computes a patch transforming source to target\n- [ ] **F2**: `patch.apply(json, mode)` applies a patch with configurable failure handling\n- [ ] **F3**: `patch1 ++ patch2` composes patches (apply first, then second)\n- [ ] **F4**: `JsonPatch.empty` is the identity element for composition\n- [ ] **F5**: Support `JsonPatchMode.Strict`, `Lenient`, and `Clobber` modes\n- [ ] **F6**: Bidirectional conversion: `toDynamicPatch` / `fromDynamicPatch`\n\n### Algebraic Laws\n\nAll laws must be verified with property-based tests (see `PatchLawsSpec` for reference):\n\n- [ ] **L1**: Left identity — `(empty ++ p)(j) == p(j)`\n- [ ] **L2**: Right identity — `(p ++ empty)(j) == p(j)`\n- [ ] **L3**: Associativity — `((p1 ++ p2) ++ p3)(j) == (p1 ++ (p2 ++ p3))(j)`\n- [ ] **L4**: Roundtrip — `diff(a, b)(a) == Right(b)`\n- [ ] **L5**: Identity diff — `diff(j, j).isEmpty`\n- [ ] **L6**: Diff composition — `(diff(a, b) ++ diff(b, c))(a) == Right(c)`\n- [ ] **L7**: Lenient subsumes Strict — if `p(j, Strict) == Right(r)` then `p(j, Lenient) == Right(r)`\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- [ ] **T1**: Property-based tests for all algebraic laws (see `PatchLawsSpec`)\n- [ ] **T2**: Test each operation type (`Set`, `PrimitiveDelta`, `ArrayEdit`, `ObjectEdit`, `Nested`)\n- [ ] **T3**: Test each `ArrayOp` variant (`Insert`, `Append`, `Delete`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T4**: Test each `ObjectOp` variant (`Add`, `Remove`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T5**: Test each `StringOp` variant (`Insert`, `Delete`, `Append`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T6**: Test `NumberDelta` with positive, negative, zero, and decimal deltas\n- [ ] **T7**: Test all three `JsonPatchMode` behaviors\n- [ ] **T8**: Test `toDynamicPatch` / `fromDynamicPatch` roundtrip\n- [ ] **T9**: Test edge cases: empty arrays, empty objects, empty strings, nested structures\n- [ ] **T10**: Test error cases: invalid paths, type mismatches, out-of-bounds indices\n\n### Documentation Requirements\n\n- [ ] **D1**: ScalaDoc for all public types and methods\n- [ ] **D2**: Usage examples in ScalaDoc (see sketch for examples)\n- [ ] **D3**: Document algebraic laws in type-level comments\n- [ ] **D4**: Document relationship to `DynamicPatch`\n\n## Related\n\n-

This type should mirror the existing `DynamicPatch` implementation, adapted for JSON's simpler data model.\n\n## Motivation\n\n`DynamicValue` has a well-designed `DynamicPatch` system with:\n- Monoid composition (`++` with `empty` identity)\n- LCS-based sequence diffing\n- Primitive delta operations (numeric deltas, string edits)\n- Comprehensive algebraic laws verified by property tests\n\nThe proposed `Json` type (see #TBD) needs equivalent patching capabilities. Rather than converting `Json ↔ DynamicValue` for every patch operation, a native `JsonPatch` provides:\n- Type safety (no conversion errors for JSON-incompatible DynamicPatch operations)\n- API consistency with the `Json` type\n- Potential for JSON-specific optimizations\n\n## Design Sketch\n\nA design sketch is available at [`[schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala](https://claude.ai/chat/schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala)`](./schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala). This sketch is **a guide, not a specification** — implementers should use judgment and deviate where appropriate.\n\n### Core Types\n\nThe design mirrors `DynamicPatch` with JSON-specific adaptations:\n\n| DynamicPatch | JsonPatch | Notes |\n|--------------|-----------|-------|\n| `DynamicPatch(Vector[DynamicPatchOp])` | `JsonPatch(Vector[JsonPatchOp])` | Same structure |\n| `Operation.Set` | `Op.Set` | Same |\n| `Operation.PrimitiveDelta` | `Op.PrimitiveDelta` | Simplified for JSON types |\n| `Operation.SequenceEdit` | `Op.ArrayEdit` | Renamed |\n| `Operation.MapEdit` | `Op.ObjectEdit` | String keys only |\n| `Operation.Patch` | `Op.Nested` | Same |\n| `SeqOp` | `ArrayOp` | Same operations |\n| `MapOp` | `ObjectOp` | String keys only |\n| `PrimitiveOp` (14 variants) | `PrimitiveOp` (2 variants) | See below |\n\n### Primitive Operations\n\nJSON has a simpler type system than `DynamicValue`:\n\n| JSON Type | Delta Operation | Notes |\n|-----------|-----------------|-------|\n| Number | `NumberDelta(BigDecimal)` | Unifies all numeric deltas |\n| String | `StringEdit(Vector[StringOp])` | Same as `DynamicPatch` |\n| Boolean | Use `Op.Set` | No delta (same as `DynamicPatch`) |\n| Null | Use `Op.Set` | No delta |\n\n### StringOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.StringOp` exactly:\n- `Insert(index: Int, text: String)`\n- `Delete(index: Int, length: Int)`\n- `Append(text: String)`\n- `Modify(index: Int, length: Int, text: String)`\n\n### ArrayOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.SeqOp`:\n- `Insert(index: Int, values: Vector[Json])`\n- `Append(values: Vector[Json])`\n- `Delete(index: Int, count: Int)`\n- `Modify(index: Int, op: Op)`\n\n### ObjectOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.MapOp` with string keys:\n- `Add(key: String, value: Json)`\n- `Remove(key: String)`\n- `Modify(key: String, patch: JsonPatch)`\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- [ ] **F1**: `JsonPatch.diff(source, target)` computes a patch transforming source to target\n- [ ] **F2**: `patch.apply(json, mode)` applies a patch with configurable failure handling\n- [ ] **F3**: `patch1 ++ patch2` composes patches (apply first, then second)\n- [ ] **F4**: `JsonPatch.empty` is the identity element for composition\n- [ ] **F5**: Support `JsonPatchMode.Strict`, `Lenient`, and `Clobber` modes\n- [ ] **F6**: Bidirectional conversion: `toDynamicPatch` / `fromDynamicPatch`\n\n### Algebraic Laws\n\nAll laws must be verified with property-based tests (see `PatchLawsSpec` for reference):\n\n- [ ] **L1**: Left identity — `(empty ++ p)(j) == p(j)`\n- [ ] **L2**: Right identity — `(p ++ empty)(j) == p(j)`\n- [ ] **L3**: Associativity — `((p1 ++ p2) ++ p3)(j) == (p1 ++ (p2 ++ p3))(j)`\n- [ ] **L4**: Roundtrip — `diff(a, b)(a) == Right(b)`\n- [ ] **L5**: Identity diff — `diff(j, j).isEmpty`\n- [ ] **L6**: Diff composition — `(diff(a, b) ++ diff(b, c))(a) == Right(c)`\n- [ ] **L7**: Lenient subsumes Strict — if `p(j, Strict) == Right(r)` then `p(j, Lenient) == Right(r)`\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- [ ] **T1**: Property-based tests for all algebraic laws (see `PatchLawsSpec`)\n- [ ] **T2**: Test each operation type (`Set`, `PrimitiveDelta`, `ArrayEdit`, `ObjectEdit`, `Nested`)\n- [ ] **T3**: Test each `ArrayOp` variant (`Insert`, `Append`, `Delete`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T4**: Test each `ObjectOp` variant (`Add`, `Remove`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T5**: Test each `StringOp` variant (`Insert`, `Delete`, `Append`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T6**: Test `NumberDelta` with positive, negative, zero, and decimal deltas\n- [ ]
