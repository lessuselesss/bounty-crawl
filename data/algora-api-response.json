This is making it so I can't use the integration.\r\n\r\nWe also use Fastmail and have been seeing some oddities with the [cal.com](http://cal.com/) integration. Namely, that participants are receiving multiple calendar invites, which on it's own isn't that big of a deal. However, the Fastmail invites are always in UTC, not in the local time of the cal.com invite.\r\n\r\nThis is creating a lot of confusion with participants, they keep missing our meetings, not realizing one invite is UTC and one in local time. I spoke with the Fastmail team and they relayed the following notes about cal's specific integration.\r\n\r\n1. There is a property (SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT) a CalDAV client can add to the event that would prevent CalDAV servers from sending invitations. It appears cal.com is not setting this property even though they are sending an invitation.\r\n2. The invitation being sent by [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is using a different UID. Basically every event has a UID that uniquely identifies the event. Since [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is sending the invitation of the event with a different UID, if you end up adding this event to your calendar [cal.com](http://cal.com/), it will create a duplicate event in your calendar as well. They need to fix it so that all emails associated with a single event use the same original UID.\r\n3. The event added from [cal.com](http://cal.com/) doesn't have a timezone associated with it. Though it mentions the invitees timezone as \"America/Chicago\" in the notes, the event itself doesn't include a timezone and only specifies the time in UTC. Since the event time is specified in UTC, Fastmail's invitation email will also be sent in UTC.\r\n4. There seems to be no way to stop Cal.com from creating the calendar events at all, and thus no real workaround.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Connect to Fastmail using CalDav integration\r\n2. Create a test booking\r\n3. See issues above.\r\n\r\nAny other relevant information. For example, why do you consider this a bug and what did you expect to happen instead?\r\n1. SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT should be set, so Fastmail knows not to send an invitation. **This is the main one.**\r\n2. UID should be unique per event.\r\n3. Event time should have a timezone associated with it.\r\n4. An option could be added to make calendar event creation optional (nice-to-have, not essential).\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\n\r\nNone other than Fastmail/CalDAV.",

                  "body": "Idea: MUDs should be able to provide an easy to use link with their connection info to spawn Mudlet and get it to connect to their game. Similar to apt://, steam:// and so forth links.\r\n\r\nI think Mudlet should support those types of links - it'd be a lot more convenient for players to try out new MUDs if they only have to click on a link, instead of copying the server and port, going to Mudlet, making a new profile and so on.\r\n\r\nAs for the naming of the link, we could either go with a custom one: mudlet:// or - use an already standard one (telnet://), which would be much better as some websites use it already (http://dmud.thebbs.org/lotflink.htm) and it would be compatible with other MUDs clients.\r\n\r\nI believe the latter option is better.\r\n\r\nTelnet links seem to work in the format of: telnet://<server>[:<optional port #>], see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4248 for the actual spec.\r\n\r\nThe logic for this could be the following:\r\n\r\nWhen Mudlet is spawned via the telnet link, check to see if any profile(s) server matches server field of the link. If multiple profiles do, auto-load the latest profile used. If one matches, load that profile. If not profiles match...\r\n\r\nCreate a new profile with the given server and port data, and the profiles name will be the servers name as well. Auto-load this newly created profile.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think these cases sound plausible. There'll an issue with peoples already made profile using the server name vs IP address directly as webmasters might, but that's not something that could be easily avoided.\r\n\r\nLaunchpad Details: [#LP1187243](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1187243) Vadim Peretokin - 2013-06-04 04:47:05 +0000",

              "body": "Idea: MUDs should be able to provide an easy to use link with their connection info to spawn Mudlet and get it to connect to their game. Similar to apt://, steam:// and so forth links.\r\n\r\nI think Mudlet should support those types of links - it'd be a lot more convenient for players to try out new MUDs if they only have to click on a link, instead of copying the server and port, going to Mudlet, making a new profile and so on.\r\n\r\nAs for the naming of the link, we could either go with a custom one: mudlet:// or - use an already standard one (telnet://), which would be much better as some websites use it already (http://dmud.thebbs.org/lotflink.htm) and it would be compatible with other MUDs clients.\r\n\r\nI believe the latter option is better.\r\n\r\nTelnet links seem to work in the format of: telnet://<server>[:<optional port #>], see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4248 for the actual spec.\r\n\r\nThe logic for this could be the following:\r\n\r\nWhen Mudlet is spawned via the telnet link, check to see if any profile(s) server matches server field of the link. If multiple profiles do, auto-load the latest profile used. If one matches, load that profile. If not profiles match...\r\n\r\nCreate a new profile with the given server and port data, and the profiles name will be the servers name as well. Auto-load this newly created profile.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think these cases sound plausible. There'll an issue with peoples already made profile using the server name vs IP address directly as webmasters might, but that's not something that could be easily avoided.\r\n\r\nLaunchpad Details: [#LP1187243](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1187243) Vadim Peretokin - 2013-06-04 04:47:05 +0000",

                  "body": "## Overview\n\nImplement a **pure, algebraic migration system** for ZIO Schema 2 that represents **structural transformations between schema versions** as first-class, serializable data.\n\nA migration describes how to transform data from one schema version to another, enabling:\n\n* schema evolution\n* backward / forward compatibility\n* data versioning\n* offline migrations (JSON, SQL, data lakes, registries, etc.)\n\nThe system provides a **typed, macro-validated user API** (`Migration[A, B]`) built on a **pure, serializable core** (`DynamicMigration`) that operates on `DynamicValue`. \n\nThe ADT is fully introspectable and can be used to generate DDL, etc.\n\n## Motivation & Big Picture\n\n### Why structural types?\n\nWhen evolving schemas over time, **older versions of data types should not require runtime representations**.\n\nIn this design:\n\n* **Current versions** are represented by real case classes / enums\n* **Past versions** are represented using:\n\n  * **structural types** for records\n  * **abstract types + intersection types** for sum types\n\nThese types:\n\n* exist **only at compile time**\n* have **no runtime representation**\n* introduce **zero runtime overhead**\n* do **not require optics or instances to be kept around**\n\nThis allows you to describe arbitrarily old versions of data *without polluting your runtime or codebase*.\n\n#### Typical Workflow\n\nA typical workflow looks like:\n\n1. You have a current type:\n\n   ```scala\n   @schema\n   case class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n   ```\n\n2. You derive and copy its structural shape:\n\n   ```scala\n   type PersonV1 = { val name: String; val age: Int }\n   ```\n\n3. You evolve the real type:\n\n   ```scala\n   @schema\n   case class Person(fullName: String, age: Int, country: String)\n   ```\n\n4. You keep only:\n\n   * the **current** runtime type\n   * the **structural type** for the old version\n   * a **pure migration** between them\n\nNo old case classes. No old optics. No runtime baggage.\n\n---\n\n### Why pure data migrations?\n\nMigrations are represented entirely as **pure data**:\n\n* no user functions\n* no closures\n* no reflection\n* no runtime code generation\n\nAs a result:\n\n* migrations can be **serialized**\n* stored in **registries**\n* applied **dynamically**\n* inspected and transformed\n* used to generate:\n\n  * upgraders\n  * downgraders\n  * SQL DDL / DML\n  * offline data transforms\n\nWhile code generation is **out of scope for this ticket**, this explains many design decisions (invertibility, path-based actions, no functions).\n\n---\n\n## Core Architecture\n\n### Type Hierarchy\n\n```scala\n// Typed migration (user-facing API)\ncase class Migration[A, B](\n  dynamicMigration: DynamicMigration,\n  sourceSchema: Schema[A],\n  targetSchema: Schema[B]\n) {\n  /** Apply migration to transform A to B */\n  def apply(value: A): Either[MigrationError, B]\n\n  /** Compose migrations sequentially */\n  def ++[C](that: Migration[B, C]): Migration[A, C]\n\n  /** Alias for ++ */\n  def andThen[C](that: Migration[B, C]): Migration[A, C] = this ++ that\n\n  /** Reverse migration (structural inverse; runtime is best-effort) */\n  def reverse: Migration[B, A]\n}\n```\n\n```scala\n// Untyped migration (pure data, fully serializable)\ncase class DynamicMigration(\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) {\n  def apply(value: DynamicValue): Either[MigrationError, DynamicValue]\n  def ++(that: DynamicMigration): DynamicMigration\n  def reverse: DynamicMigration\n}\n```\n\n* `Migration[A, B]` is introspectable, but not pure data due to bindings inside schemas\n* `DynamicMigration` is **fully serializable**\n\n---\n\n## User-Facing API: Selector Expressions\n\n### Selectors, not optics\n\nThe user-facing API **does not expose optics**.\n\nInstead, all locations are specified using **selector expressions**:\n\n```scala\nS => A\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```scala\n_.name\n_.address.street\n_.addresses.each.streetNumber\n_.country.when[UK]\n```\n\nTo see the syntax, one can look at the `optic` macro, which utilizes the same selector syntax for optic creation (e.g. `optic(_.address.street)`, etc.).\n\n### Macro extraction\n\nAll builder methods that accept selectors are **implemented via macros** (or via a macro-generated type class such as `ToDynamicOptic`).\n\nThe macro:\n\n1. Inspects the selector expression\n2. Validates it is a supported projection\n3. Converts it into a `DynamicOptic`\n4. Stores that optic in the migration action\n\nSupported projections include:\n\n* field access (`_.foo.bar`)\n* case selection (`_.country.when[UK]`)\n* collection traversal (`_.items.each`)\n* (future) key access, wrappers, etc.\n\n`DynamicOptic` is **never exposed publicly**.\n\n---\n\n## Migration Builder\n\nAll selector-accepting methods are implemented via macros.

              "body": "## Overview\n\nImplement a **pure, algebraic migration system** for ZIO Schema 2 that represents **structural transformations between schema versions** as first-class, serializable data.\n\nA migration describes how to transform data from one schema version to another, enabling:\n\n* schema evolution\n* backward / forward compatibility\n* data versioning\n* offline migrations (JSON, SQL, data lakes, registries, etc.)\n\nThe system provides a **typed, macro-validated user API** (`Migration[A, B]`) built on a **pure, serializable core** (`DynamicMigration`) that operates on `DynamicValue`. \n\nThe ADT is fully introspectable and can be used to generate DDL, etc.\n\n## Motivation & Big Picture\n\n### Why structural types?\n\nWhen evolving schemas over time, **older versions of data types should not require runtime representations**.\n\nIn this design:\n\n* **Current versions** are represented by real case classes / enums\n* **Past versions** are represented using:\n\n  * **structural types** for records\n  * **abstract types + intersection types** for sum types\n\nThese types:\n\n* exist **only at compile time**\n* have **no runtime representation**\n* introduce **zero runtime overhead**\n* do **not require optics or instances to be kept around**\n\nThis allows you to describe arbitrarily old versions of data *without polluting your runtime or codebase*.\n\n#### Typical Workflow\n\nA typical workflow looks like:\n\n1. You have a current type:\n\n   ```scala\n   @schema\n   case class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n   ```\n\n2. You derive and copy its structural shape:\n\n   ```scala\n   type PersonV1 = { val name: String; val age: Int }\n   ```\n\n3. You evolve the real type:\n\n   ```scala\n   @schema\n   case class Person(fullName: String, age: Int, country: String)\n   ```\n\n4. You keep only:\n\n   * the **current** runtime type\n   * the **structural type** for the old version\n   * a **pure migration** between them\n\nNo old case classes. No old optics. No runtime baggage.\n\n---\n\n### Why pure data migrations?\n\nMigrations are represented entirely as **pure data**:\n\n* no user functions\n* no closures\n* no reflection\n* no runtime code generation\n\nAs a result:\n\n* migrations can be **serialized**\n* stored in **registries**\n* applied **dynamically**\n* inspected and transformed\n* used to generate:\n\n  * upgraders\n  * downgraders\n  * SQL DDL / DML\n  * offline data transforms\n\nWhile code generation is **out of scope for this ticket**, this explains many design decisions (invertibility, path-based actions, no functions).\n\n---\n\n## Core Architecture\n\n### Type Hierarchy\n\n```scala\n// Typed migration (user-facing API)\ncase class Migration[A, B](\n  dynamicMigration: DynamicMigration,\n  sourceSchema: Schema[A],\n  targetSchema: Schema[B]\n) {\n  /** Apply migration to transform A to B */\n  def apply(value: A): Either[MigrationError, B]\n\n  /** Compose migrations sequentially */\n  def ++[C](that: Migration[B, C]): Migration[A, C]\n\n  /** Alias for ++ */\n  def andThen[C](that: Migration[B, C]): Migration[A, C] = this ++ that\n\n  /** Reverse migration (structural inverse; runtime is best-effort) */\n  def reverse: Migration[B, A]\n}\n```\n\n```scala\n// Untyped migration (pure data, fully serializable)\ncase class DynamicMigration(\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) {\n  def apply(value: DynamicValue): Either[MigrationError, DynamicValue]\n  def ++(that: DynamicMigration): DynamicMigration\n  def reverse: DynamicMigration\n}\n```\n\n* `Migration[A, B]` is introspectable, but not pure data due to bindings inside schemas\n* `DynamicMigration` is **fully serializable**\n\n---\n\n## User-Facing API: Selector Expressions\n\n### Selectors, not optics\n\nThe user-facing API **does not expose optics**.\n\nInstead, all locations are specified using **selector expressions**:\n\n```scala\nS => A\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```scala\n_.name\n_.address.street\n_.addresses.each.streetNumber\n_.country.when[UK]\n```\n\nTo see the syntax, one can look at the `optic` macro, which utilizes the same selector syntax for optic creation (e.g. `optic(_.address.street)`, etc.).\n\n### Macro extraction\n\nAll builder methods that accept selectors are **implemented via macros** (or via a macro-generated type class such as `ToDynamicOptic`).\n\nThe macro:\n\n1. Inspects the selector expression\n2. Validates it is a supported projection\n3. Converts it into a `DynamicOptic`\n4. Stores that optic in the migration action\n\nSupported projections include:\n\n* field access (`_.foo.bar`)\n* case selection (`_.country.when[UK]`)\n* collection traversal (`_.items.each`)\n* (future) key access, wrappers, etc.\n\n`DynamicOptic` is **never exposed publicly**.\n\n---\n\n## Migration Builder\n\nAll selector-accepting methods are implemented via macros. For simplicity, these are shown as functions (e.g. `A => Any`), but this is NOT the way to implement them. Either all these functions need to be macros, or a macro needs to be used to generate an implicit / given at each call site. Macros may do additional validation to constrain the validity of these different types of transformations.\n\n```scala\nclass MigrationBuilder[A, B](\n  sourceSchema: Schema[A],\n  targetSchema: Schema[B],\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) {\n\n  // ----- Record operations -----\n\n  def addField(\n    target: B => Any,\n    default: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def dropField(\n    source: A => Any,\n    defaultForReverse: SchemaExpr[B, ?] = SchemaExpr.DefaultValue\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def renameField(\n    from: A => Any,\n    to: B => Any\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformField(\n    from: A => Any,\n    to: B => Any,\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def mandateField(\n    source: A => Option[?],\n    target: B => Any,\n    default: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def optionalizeField(\n    source: A => Any,\n    target: B => Option[?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def changeFieldType(\n    source: A => Any,\n    target: B => Any,\n    converter: SchemaExpr[A, ?]  // primitive-to-primitive only\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Enum operations (limited) -----\n\n  def renameCase[SumA, SumB](\n    from: String,\n    to: String\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformCase[SumA, CaseA, SumB, CaseB](\n    caseMigration: MigrationBuilder[CaseA, CaseB] => MigrationBuilder[CaseA, CaseB]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Collections -----\n\n  def transformElements(\n    at: A => Vector[?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Maps -----\n\n  def transformKeys(\n    at: A => Map[?, ?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformValues(\n    at: A => Map[?, ?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  /** Build migration with full macro validation */\n  def build: Migration[A, B]\n\n  /** Build migration without full validation */\n  def buildPartial: Migration[A, B]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Migration Actions (Untyped Core)\n\nAll actions operate at a **path**, represented by `DynamicOptic`.\n\n```scala\nsealed trait MigrationAction {\n  def at: DynamicOptic\n  def reverse: MigrationAction\n}\n```\n\n### Record Actions\n\n```scala\ncase class AddField(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  default: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class DropField(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  defaultForReverse: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Rename(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  to: String\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformValue(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Mandate(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  default: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Optionalize(\n  at: DynamicOptic\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Join(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  sourcePaths: Vector[DynamicOptic],\n  combiner: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Split(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  targetPaths: Vector[DynamicOptic],\n  splitter: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class ChangeType(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  converter: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n---\n\n### Enum Actions (Supported)\n\n```scala\ncase class RenameCase(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  from: String,\n  to: String\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformCase(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n> Enum case addition / removal is **out of scope** for this ticket\n> (requires composite value construction).\n\n---\n\n### Collection / Map Actions\n\n```scala\ncase class TransformElements(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformKeys(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformValues(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n---\n\n## SchemaExpr Integration\n\n* Used for all value-level transformations\n* **Constraints for this ticket**:\n\n  * primitive → primitive only\n  * joins / splits must produce primitives\n  * no record / enum construction\n\n### `SchemaExpr.DefaultValue`\n\nA special expression that:\n\n1. uses the macro-captured field schema\n2. calls `schema.defaultValue`\n3. converts the value to `DynamicValue`\n4. is stored for reverse migrations\n\n---\n\n## Type Modeling\n\n### Records (Structural Types)\n\n```scala\ntype PersonV0 = { val firstName: String;

                  "body": "## Overview\n\nAdd two related type classes for type-safe schema evolution:\n\n1. **`Into[A, B]`**: One-way conversion from `A` to `B` with runtime validation\n2. **`As[A, B]`**: Bidirectional conversion establishing a partial equivalence between `A` and `B`\n\nBoth type classes are automatically derived via macros that intelligently map fields using names, positions, and types, with support for validation, coercion, and schema evolution patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Type Class Definitions\n\n### Into[A, B] - One-Way Conversion\n\n```scala\ntrait Into[-A, +B] {\n  def into(input: A): Either[SchemaError, B]\n}\n```\n\n**Purpose**: Convert from source type `A` to target type `B`, potentially failing at runtime when validation constraints cannot be satisfied.\n\n**Use Cases**:\n- Migrating between schema versions\n- Converting between equivalent representations\n- Validating conversions with opaque types\n- Transforming external data into internal models\n\n### As[A, B] - Bidirectional Conversion\n\n```scala\ntrait As[A, B] {\n  def into(input: A): Either[SchemaError, B]\n  def from(input: B): Either[SchemaError, A]\n}\n```\n\n**Purpose**: Establish a partial equivalence between types `A` and `B` where conversion can fail in either direction due to runtime validation.\n\n**Use Cases**:\n- Isomorphic schema versions\n- Equivalent representations (e.g., case class ↔ tuple)\n- Reversible transformations with runtime validation\n- Round-trip serialization/deserialization\n\n**Relationship**: `As[A, B]` implies both `Into[A, B]` and `Into[B, A]` exist, but with the additional guarantee that both conversions use compatible mapping logic and can round-trip (subject to runtime validation).\n\n**Note**: `SchemaError` is composable, allowing multiple validation failures to be combined into a single error.\n\n---\n\n## Core Conversion Rules\n\n### Field Mapping Algorithm\n\nThe macro establishes field mappings using three attributes:\n1. **Field name** (identifier in source code)\n2. **Field position** (ordinal position in declaration)\n3. **Field type** (including coercible types)\n\n**Priority for disambiguation:**\n1. **Exact match**: Same name + same type\n2. **Name match with coercion**: Same name + coercible type\n3. **Unique type match**: Type appears only once in both source and target\n4. **Position + unique type**: Positional correspondence with unambiguous type\n5. **Fallback**: If no unambiguous mapping exists, derivation fails at compile-time\n\n### Mapping Examples\n\n#### Unambiguous by Unique Types\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int, active: Boolean)\ncase class User(username: String, yearsOld: Int, enabled: Boolean)\n\n// Success: Each type appears exactly once\n// Mapping: String→String, Int→Int, Boolean→Boolean\n```\n\n#### Unambiguous by Names\n```scala\ncase class Point(x: Int, y: Int)\ncase class Coord(y: Int, x: Int)\n\n// Success: Names uniquely identify despite reordering\n// Mapping: x→x, y→y\n```\n\n#### Ambiguous - Compile Failure\n```scala\ncase class Dimensions(width: Int, height: Int)\ncase class Measurements(first: Int, second: Int)\n\n// COMPILE ERROR: Cannot determine mapping\n// Both Int types, different names, ambiguous positional match\n```\n\n#### Disambiguation by Position (Tuples)\n```scala\ncase class RGB(r: Int, g: Int, b: Int)\ntype ColorTuple = (Int, Int, Int)\n\n// Success: Position disambiguates\n// Mapping: r→_1, g→_2, b→_3\n```\n\n---\n\n## Supported Conversions\n\n### 1. Product Types (Records)\n\n#### Case Class to Case Class\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(fullName: String, age: Int)\n\n// Success if 'name' is unique String in V1 and 'fullName' is unique String in V2\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", 30))\n```\n\n#### Case Class to Tuple\n```scala\ncase class Point(x: Double, y: Double)\n\nInto[Point, (Double, Double)].into(Point(1.0, 2.0))\n// => Right((1.0, 2.0))\n```\n\n#### Tuple to Case Class\n```scala\ncase class RGB(red: Int, green: Int, blue: Int)\n\nInto[(Int, Int, Int), RGB].into((255, 128, 64))\n// => Right(RGB(255, 128, 64))\n```\n\n#### Tuple to Tuple\n```scala\nInto[(Int, String), (Long, String)].into((42, \"hello\"))\n// => Right((42L, \"hello\"))\n```\n\n### 2. Coproduct Types (Sum Types)\n\n#### Sealed Trait to Sealed Trait (by name)\n```scala\nsealed trait Color\ncase object Red extends Color\ncase object Blue extends Color\n\nsealed trait Hue\ncase object Red extends Hue\ncase object Blue extends Hue\n\nInto[Color, Hue].into(Red)\n// => Right(Red)\n```\n\n#### Sealed Trait to Sealed Trait (by signature)\n```scala\nsealed trait EventV1\ncase class Created(id: String, ts: Long) extends EventV1\ncase class Deleted(id: String) extends EventV1\n\nsealed trait EventV2\ncase class Spawned(id: String, ts: Long) extends EventV2\ncase class Removed(id: String) extends EventV2\n\nInto[EventV1, EventV2].into(Created(\"abc\", 123L))\n// => Right(Spawned(\"abc\", 123L))\n// Matched by constructor signature (String, Long)\n```\n\n#### Enum to Enum (Scala 3)\n```scala\nenum Status:\n  case Active, Inactive, Suspended\n\nenum State:\n  case Active, Inactive, Suspended\n\nInto[Status, State].into(Status.Active)\n// => Right(State.Active)\n```\n\n#### ADT with Payload Conversion\n```scala\nsealed trait ResultV1\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends ResultV1\ncase class Failure(msg: String) extends ResultV1\n\nsealed trait ResultV2\ncase class Success(value: Long) extends ResultV2\ncase class Failure(msg: String) extends ResultV2\n\nInto[ResultV1, ResultV2].into(Success(42))\n// => Right(Success(42L))\n// Field type coercion within matched case\n```\n\n### 3.

Collection Type Conversions\n\n#### Between Standard Collection Types\n```scala\nInto[List[Int], Vector[Int]].into(List(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(Vector(1, 2, 3))\n\nInto[Vector[String], List[String]].into(Vector(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"))\n// => Right(List(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"))\n\nInto[Array[Int], List[Int]].into(Array(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(List(1, 2, 3))\n\nInto[List[Int], Array[Int]].into(List(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(Array(1, 2, 3))\n\nInto[Seq[Int], List[Int]].into(Seq(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(List(1, 2, 3))\n\nInto[List[Int], Seq[Int]].into(List(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(Seq(1, 2, 3))\n```\n\n#### Set Conversions (Order-Preserving Collections to Set)\n```scala\nInto[List[Int], Set[Int]].into(List(1, 2, 2, 3))\n// => Right(Set(1, 2, 3))\n// Note: Duplicates are removed\n\nInto[Vector[String], Set[String]].into(Vector(\"a\", \"b\", \"a\"))\n// => Right(Set(\"a\", \"b\"))\n```\n\n#### Set to Order-Preserving Collections\n```scala\nInto[Set[Int], List[Int]].into(Set(3, 1, 2))\n// => Right(List(1, 2, 3))\n// Note: Order is determined by Set's iteration order\n\nInto[Set[String], Vector[String]].into(Set(\"c\", \"a\", \"b\"))\n// => Right(Vector(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"))\n```\n\n#### Combined Element and Collection Type Conversion\n```scala\nInto[List[Int], Vector[Long]].into(List(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(Vector(1L, 2L, 3L))\n\nInto[Array[Short], List[Int]].into(Array(10.toShort, 20.toShort))\n// => Right(List(10, 20))\n\nInto[Set[Int], List[Long]].into(Set(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(List(1L, 2L, 3L))\n```\n\n#### Nested Collection Type Conversions\n```scala\nInto[List[Vector[Int]], Vector[List[Long]]].into(List(Vector(1, 2), Vector(3, 4)))\n// => Right(Vector(List(1L, 2L), List(3L, 4L)))\n```\n\n### 5. Structural Types\n\n#### Structural Type Targets (Scala 3 with Selectable)\n```scala\ncase class Point(x: Int, y: Int)\ntype Coord = { def x: Int; def y: Int }\n\nInto[Point, Coord].into(Point(5, 10))\n// => Right(<structural instance with x=5, y=10>)\n```\n\n#### Structural Type Targets (Scala 2 with Dynamic)\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\ntype Record = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\nInto[Person, Record].into(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n// => Right(<dynamic instance with name=\"Alice\", age=30>)\n```\n\n#### Structural Type Sources\n```scala\ntype PersonLike = { def name: String; def age: Int }\ncase class User(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval personLike: PersonLike = ??? // some structural instance\nInto[PersonLike, User].into(personLike)\n// => Right(User(\"Alice\", 30))\n```\n\n### 6. Schema Evolution Patterns\n\n#### Adding Optional Fields\n```scala\ncase class UserV1(id: String, name: String)\ncase class UserV2(id: String, name: String, email: Option[String])\n\nInto[UserV1, UserV2].into(UserV1(\"123\", \"Alice\"))\n// => Right(UserV2(\"123\", \"Alice\", None))\n```\n\n#### Removing Optional Fields\n```scala\ncase class UserV2(id: String, name: String, email: Option[String])\ncase class UserV1(id: String, name: String)\n\nInto[UserV2, UserV1].into(UserV2(\"123\", \"Alice\", Some(\"alice@example.com\")))\n// => Right(UserV1(\"123\", \"Alice\"))\n// email field is dropped\n```\n\n#### Adding Required Fields with Defaults (Scala 3)\n```scala\ncase class ProductV1(name: String, price: Double)\ncase class ProductV2(name: String, price: Double, available: Boolean = true)\n\nInto[ProductV1, ProductV2].into(ProductV1(\"Widget\", 19.99))\n// => Right(ProductV2(\"Widget\", 19.99, true))\n```\n\n#### Field Reordering\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int, email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(email: String, name: String, age: Int)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30, \"alice@example.com\"))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"alice@example.com\", \"Alice\", 30))\n```\n\n#### Field Renaming (with unique types)\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(fullName: String, yearOfBirth: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, birthYear: Int)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice Smith\", 1990))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice Smith\", 1990))\n```\n\n#### Type Refinement\n```scala\ncase class ConfigV1(port: Int, timeout: Int)\ncase class ConfigV2(port: Int, timeout: Long)\n\nInto[ConfigV1, ConfigV2].into(ConfigV1(8080, 30))\n// => Right(ConfigV2(8080, 30L))\n```\n\n### 7. Nested Conversions\n\n#### Nested Products\n```scala\ncase class AddressV1(street: String, zip: Int)\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, address: AddressV1)\n\ncase class AddressV2(street: String, zip: Long)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, address: AddressV2)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(\n  PersonV1(\"Alice\", AddressV1(\"Main St\", 12345))\n)\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", AddressV2(\"Main St\", 12345L)))\n```\n\n#### Nested Coproducts\n```scala\nsealed trait Inner\ncase class A(x: Int) extends Inner\ncase class B(y: String) extends Inner\n\nsealed trait Outer\ncase class Container(inner: Inner, label: String) extends Outer\n\n// Similar target types with Long instead of Int\nsealed trait InnerV2\ncase class A(x: Long) extends InnerV2\ncase class B(y: String) extends InnerV2\n\nsealed trait OuterV2\ncase class Container(inner: InnerV2, label: String) extends OuterV2\n\nInto[Outer, OuterV2].into(Container(A(42), \"test\"))\n// => Right(Container(A(42L), \"test\"))\n```\n\n#### Collections of Complex Types\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Long)\n\nInto[List[PersonV1], List[PersonV2]].into(\n  List(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30), PersonV1(\"Bob\", 25))\n)\n// => Right(List(PersonV2(\"Alice\", 30L), PersonV2(\"Bob\", 25L)))\n```\n\n#### Nested Collections with Type Conversions\n```scala\ncase class DataV1(values: List[Vector[Int]])\ncase class DataV2(values: Vector[List[Long]])\n\nInto[DataV1, DataV2].into(\n  DataV1(List(Vector(1, 2), Vector(3, 4)))\n)\n// => Right(DataV2(Vector(List(1L, 2L), List(3L, 4L))))\n```\n\n---\n\n## Special Type Support\n\n### Opaque Types (Scala 3)\n\nOpaque types with validation are fully supported. The macro generates runtime validation calls.\n\n```scala\n// Definition with validation\nobject Domain:\n  opaque type Age = Int\n  object Age:\n    def apply(value: Int): Either[String, Age] =\n      if value >= 0 && value <= 150 then Right(value)\n      else Left(s\"Invalid age: $value\")\n    \n    def unsafe(value: Int): Age = value\n    \n    extension (age: Age)\n      def toInt: Int = age\n\n  opaque type Email = String\n  object Email:\n    def apply(value: String): Either[String, Email] =\n      if value.contains(\"@\") then Right(value)\n      else Left(s\"Invalid email: $value\")\n    \n    extension (email: Email)\n      def toString: String = email\n\nimport Domain._\n\n// Usage\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int, email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Age, email: Email)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30, \"alice@example.com\"))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", Age.unsafe(30), Email.unsafe(\"alice@example.com\")))\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", -5, \"alice@example.com\"))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Age validation failed: Invalid age: -5\"))\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30, \"invalid\"))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Email validation failed: Invalid email: invalid\"))\n```\n\n**Macro Behavior**:\n- Detects opaque type companion objects with `apply(underlying): Either[_, OpaqueType]` method\n- Generates validation calls for each opaque type field\n- Accumulates all validation errors using `SchemaError` composition\n- Falls back to direct conversion if no validation method exists\n\n### Newtype Libraries (Scala 2)\n\n#### ZIO Prelude Newtypes (Built-in Support)\n\nThe macro includes hardcoded support for ZIO Prelude newtypes without requiring a compile-time dependency.\n\n```scala\nimport zio.prelude._\n\n// Definition with validation\nobject Domain {\n  object Age extends Subtype[Int] {\n    override def assertion = assert {\n      Assertion.between(0, 150)\n    }\n  }\n  type Age = Age.Type\n\n  object Email extends Newtype[String] {\n    override def assertion = assert {\n      Assertion.matches(\".*@.*\")\n    }\n  }\n  type Email = Email.Type\n}\n\nimport Domain._\n\n// Usage\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int, email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Age, email: Email)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30, \"alice@example.com\"))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", Age(30), Email(\"alice@example.com\")))\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 200, \"invalid\"))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Validation failed: age: 200 is not between 0 and 150, email: invalid does not match .*@.*\"))\n```\n\n**Macro Detection** (no ZIO Prelude dependency required):\n```scala\n// The macro detects ZIO Prelude newtypes by checking:\n// 1. Type extends Newtype[A] or Subtype[A]\n// 2. Companion object exists\n// 3. Has apply/wrap method with validation\n\n// Low-level AST matching in Scala 2 macro:\ndef isZIONewtype(tpe: Type): Boolean = {\n  tpe.typeSymbol.fullName.startsWith(\"zio.prelude.Newtype\") ||\n  tpe.typeSymbol.fullName.startsWith(\"zio.prelude.Subtype\")\n}\n```\n\n#### Other Newtype Libraries\n\nFor other newtype libraries, users can provide explicit `Into` instances. The macro will use these instances when available.\n\n```scala\n// User-provided instance for their newtype library\nimplicit val stringToMyNewtype: Into[String, MyNewtype] = \n  new Into[String, MyNewtype] {\n    def into(s: String): Either[SchemaError, MyNewtype] =\n      MyNewtype.make(s).left.map(e => SchemaError(e.toString))\n  }\n\n// The macro will automatically use this instance\ncase class PersonV1(email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(email: MyNewtype)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"test@example.com\"))\n// Uses the user-provided instance automatically\n```\n\n### Validation Error Accumulation\n\nWhen multiple validations fail, all errors are accumulated using `SchemaError` composition:\n\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int, email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Age, email: Email)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"\", -5, \"invalid\"))\n// => Left(SchemaError(...)) // Combined error containing all validation failures\n```\n\n---\n\n## As[A, B] Additional Requirements\n\nFor `As[A, B]` to be derivable, the bidirectional conversion must be **compatible**:\n\n### Compatibility Rules\n\n1. **Field mappings must be consistent**: The same field correspondence in both directions\n2. **Coercions must be invertible with runtime validation**: \n   - ✅ `Int` ↔ `Long` is valid (narrowing validated at runtime)\n   - ✅ `Float` ↔ `Double` is valid (narrowing validated at runtime)\n   - ✅ All numeric coercions are valid with runtime checks\n3. **Optional fields**: \n   - ✅ Can add optional fields in one direction (becomes `None` in reverse)\n   - ✅ Can remove optional fields in one direction (value is dropped)\n4. **Default values**:\n   - ❌ Cannot use default arguments (breaks round-trip guarantee)\n5. **Collection types**:\n   - ✅ Can convert between different collection types\n   - ⚠️  Set → List → Set may not preserve original order\n   - ⚠️  List → Set → List loses duplicates\n\n### Valid As[A, B] Examples\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Same structure, different names\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(fullName: String, yearsOld: Int)\n\nAs[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", 30))\n\nAs[PersonV1, PersonV2].from(PersonV2(\"Bob\", 25))\n// => Right(PersonV1(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Case class ↔ Tuple\ncase class Point(x: Double, y: Double)\n\nAs[Point, (Double, Double)].into(Point(1.0, 2.0))\n// => Right((1.0, 2.0))\n\nAs[Point, (Double, Double)].from((3.0, 4.0))\n// => Right(Point(3.0, 4.0))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Numeric coercion with runtime validation\ncase class ConfigV1(timeout: Int)\ncase class ConfigV2(timeout: Long)\n\nAs[ConfigV1, ConfigV2].into(ConfigV1(30))\n// => Right(ConfigV2(30L))\n\nAs[ConfigV1, ConfigV2].from(ConfigV2(30L))\n// => Right(ConfigV1(30))\n\nAs[ConfigV1, ConfigV2].from(ConfigV2(3000000000L))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Value 3000000000 exceeds Int.MaxValue\"))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Opaque types (reversible via unwrap)\ncase class PersonRaw(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonValidated(name: String, age: Age)\n\nAs[PersonRaw, PersonValidated].into(PersonRaw(\"Alice\", 30))\n// => Right(PersonValidated(\"Alice\", Age.unsafe(30)))\n\nAs[PersonRaw, PersonValidated].from(PersonValidated(\"Bob\", Age.unsafe(25)))\n// => Right(PersonRaw(\"Bob\", 25))\n\nAs[PersonRaw, PersonValidated].into(PersonRaw(\"Charlie\", -5))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Age validation failed: Invalid age: -5\"))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Collection type conversions\ncase class DataV1(items: List[Int])\ncase class DataV2(items: Vector[Int])\n\nAs[DataV1, DataV2].into(DataV1(List(1, 2, 3)))\n// => Right(DataV2(Vector(1, 2, 3)))\n\nAs[DataV1, DataV2].from(DataV2(Vector(4, 5, 6)))\n// => Right(DataV1(List(4, 5, 6)))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Optional field in one direction\ncase class UserV1(id: String, name: String)\ncase class UserV2(id: String, name: String, email: Option[String])\n\nAs[UserV1, UserV2].into(UserV1(\"123\", \"Alice\"))\n// => Right(UserV2(\"123\", \"Alice\", None))\n\nAs[UserV1, UserV2].from(UserV2(\"456\", \"Bob\", Some(\"bob@example.com\")))\n// => Right(UserV1(\"456\", \"Bob\"))\n// email is dropped in reverse direction\n```\n\n### Non-Ideal As[A, B] Examples (Valid but Lossy)\n\n```scala\n// Valid but lossy: List with duplicates → Set → List\ncase class DataV1(values: List[Int])\ncase class DataV2(values: Set[Int])\n\nAs[DataV1, DataV2].into(DataV1(List(1, 2, 2, 3)))\n// => Right(DataV2(Set(1, 2, 3)))\n\nAs[DataV1, DataV2].from(DataV2(Set(1, 2, 3)))\n// => Right(DataV1(List(1, 2, 3)))\n// Original duplicates are lost, but conversion is valid\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid but lossy: Set → List → Set (order may change)\ncase class DataV1(values: Set[Int])\ncase class DataV2(values: List[Int])\n\nval original = DataV1(Set(3, 1, 2))\nval converted = As[DataV1, DataV2].into(original).right.get\n// converted.values might be List(1, 2, 3) depending on Set iteration order\n\nval roundTrip = As[DataV1, DataV2].from(converted).right.get\n// roundTrip.values == Set(1, 2, 3) - same elements, possibly different internal order\n```\n\n### Invalid As[A, B] Examples\n\n```scala\n// Invalid: Default values break round-trip guarantee\ncase class ProductV1(name: String, price: Double)\ncase class ProductV2(name: String, price: Double, taxable: Boolean = true)\n\n// COMPILE ERROR: Cannot derive As[ProductV1, ProductV2]\n// Reason: Default value for 'taxable' cannot be recovered in reverse direction\n// (We can't distinguish between explicitly set 'true' and default 'true')\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Matrix Dimensions\n\n1. **Type Combinations** (both `Into` and `As`)\n   - Primitive → Primitive (all coercion pairs, including narrowing)\n   - Product → Product (case classes)\n   - Product → Tuple\n   - Tuple → Product\n   - Tuple → Tuple\n   - Coproduct → Coproduct (sealed traits, enums)\n   - Collection[A] → Collection[B] (List, Vector, Set, Map, Option, Either, Array, Seq)\n   - Collection type conversions (List ↔ Vector ↔ Set ↔ Array ↔ Seq)\n   - Nested conversions\n   - Structural types\n\n2. **Disambiguation Scenarios**\n   - Unique types (names irrelevant)\n   - Matching names (types irrelevant with coercion)\n   - Duplicate types with name disambiguation\n   - Duplicate types with position disambiguation\n   - Ambiguous cases (must fail at compile-time)\n\n3. **Schema Evolution**\n   - Field reordering\n   - Field renaming (with unique types)\n   - Adding optional fields\n   - Removing optional fields\n   - Type refinement (Int → Long, with narrowing validation)\n   - Adding default values (Scala 3)\n\n4. **Validation** (Scala 3 opaque types)\n   - Valid values pass through\n   - Invalid values produce SchemaError\n   - Multiple validation failures accumulate\n   - Nested validation in products\n   - Validation in coproduct cases\n   - Validation in collections\n   - Narrowing conversions (Long → Int with overflow check)\n\n5. **Validation** (Scala 2 ZIO Prelude newtypes)\n   - Newtype validation success\n   - Newtype validation failure\n   - Subtype validation with assertions\n   - Multiple newtype fields\n\n6. **Collection Type Conversions**\n   - List ↔ Vector\n   - List ↔ Array\n   - List ↔ Set (with duplicate handling)\n   - List ↔ Seq\n   - Vector ↔ Set\n   - Array ↔ Vector\n   - All combinations with element type coercion\n   - Nested collection type conversions\n\n7. **Runtime Validation** (for `As[A, B]`)\n   - Numeric narrowing validation\n   - Round-trip with valid narrowing\n   - Round-trip failure with overflow\n   - Collection conversions with duplicates\n   - Optional field round-trips\n\n8. **Error Cases**\n   - Ambiguous field mapping (compile error)\n   - Ambiguous case mapping (compile error)\n   - Default value in `As` (compile error)\n   - Runtime validation failures\n   - Type mismatch (compile error)\n   - Overflow in narrowing conversions\n\n9. **Edge Cases**\n   - Empty case classes\n   - Single-field case classes\n   - Case objects\n   - Sealed traits with case objects only\n   - Deeply nested structures (5+ levels)\n   - Large products (20+ fields)\n   - Large coproducts (20+ cases)\n   - Recursive types (e.g., `case class Tree(value: Int, children: List[Tree])`)\n   - Mutually recursive types\n\n### Test Organization\n\n```\nsrc/test/scala/\n  into/\n    products/\n      CaseClassToCaseClassSpec.scala\n      CaseClassToTupleSpec.scala\n      TupleToCaseClassSpec.scala\n

              "body": "## Overview\n\nAdd two related type classes for type-safe schema evolution:\n\n1. **`Into[A, B]`**: One-way conversion from `A` to `B` with runtime validation\n2. **`As[A, B]`**: Bidirectional conversion establishing a partial equivalence between `A` and `B`\n\nBoth type classes are automatically derived via macros that intelligently map fields using names, positions, and types, with support for validation, coercion, and schema evolution patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Type Class Definitions\n\n### Into[A, B] - One-Way Conversion\n\n```scala\ntrait Into[-A, +B] {\n  def into(input: A): Either[SchemaError, B]\n}\n```\n\n**Purpose**: Convert from source type `A` to target type `B`, potentially failing at runtime when validation constraints cannot be satisfied.\n\n**Use Cases**:\n- Migrating between schema versions\n- Converting between equivalent representations\n- Validating conversions with opaque types\n- Transforming external data into internal models\n\n### As[A, B] - Bidirectional Conversion\n\n```scala\ntrait As[A, B] {\n  def into(input: A): Either[SchemaError, B]\n  def from(input: B): Either[SchemaError, A]\n}\n```\n\n**Purpose**: Establish a partial equivalence between types `A` and `B` where conversion can fail in either direction due to runtime validation.\n\n**Use Cases**:\n- Isomorphic schema versions\n- Equivalent representations (e.g., case class ↔ tuple)\n- Reversible transformations with runtime validation\n- Round-trip serialization/deserialization\n\n**Relationship**: `As[A, B]` implies both `Into[A, B]` and `Into[B, A]` exist, but with the additional guarantee that both conversions use compatible mapping logic and can round-trip (subject to runtime validation).\n\n**Note**: `SchemaError` is composable, allowing multiple validation failures to be combined into a single error.\n\n---\n\n## Core Conversion Rules\n\n### Field Mapping Algorithm\n\nThe macro establishes field mappings using three attributes:\n1. **Field name** (identifier in source code)\n2. **Field position** (ordinal position in declaration)\n3. **Field type** (including coercible types)\n\n**Priority for disambiguation:**\n1. **Exact match**: Same name + same type\n2. **Name match with coercion**: Same name + coercible type\n3. **Unique type match**: Type appears only once in both source and target\n4. **Position + unique type**: Positional correspondence with unambiguous type\n5. **Fallback**: If no unambiguous mapping exists, derivation fails at compile-time\n\n### Mapping Examples\n\n#### Unambiguous by Unique Types\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int, active: Boolean)\ncase class User(username: String, yearsOld: Int, enabled: Boolean)\n\n// Success: Each type appears exactly once\n// Mapping: String→String, Int→Int, Boolean→Boolean\n```\n\n#### Unambiguous by Names\n```scala\ncase class Point(x: Int, y: Int)\ncase class Coord(y: Int, x: Int)\n\n// Success: Names uniquely identify despite reordering\n// Mapping: x→x, y→y\n```\n\n#### Ambiguous - Compile Failure\n```scala\ncase class Dimensions(width: Int, height: Int)\ncase class Measurements(first: Int, second: Int)\n\n// COMPILE ERROR: Cannot determine mapping\n// Both Int types, different names, ambiguous positional match\n```\n\n#### Disambiguation by Position (Tuples)\n```scala\ncase class RGB(r: Int, g: Int, b: Int)\ntype ColorTuple = (Int, Int, Int)\n\n// Success: Position disambiguates\n// Mapping: r→_1, g→_2, b→_3\n```\n\n---\n\n## Supported Conversions\n\n### 1. Product Types (Records)\n\n#### Case Class to Case Class\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(fullName: String, age: Int)\n\n// Success if 'name' is unique String in V1 and 'fullName' is unique String in V2\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", 30))\n```\n\n#### Case Class to Tuple\n```scala\ncase class Point(x: Double, y: Double)\n\nInto[Point, (Double, Double)].into(Point(1.0, 2.0))\n// => Right((1.0, 2.0))\n```\n\n#### Tuple to Case Class\n```scala\ncase class RGB(red: Int, green: Int, blue: Int)\n\nInto[(Int, Int, Int), RGB].into((255, 128, 64))\n// => Right(RGB(255, 128, 64))\n```\n\n#### Tuple to Tuple\n```scala\nInto[(Int, String), (Long, String)].into((42, \"hello\"))\n// => Right((42L, \"hello\"))\n```\n\n### 2.

Nested Conversions\n\n#### Nested Products\n```scala\ncase class AddressV1(street: String, zip: Int)\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, address: AddressV1)\n\ncase class AddressV2(street: String, zip: Long)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, address: AddressV2)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(\n  PersonV1(\"Alice\", AddressV1(\"Main St\", 12345))\n)\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", AddressV2(\"Main St\", 12345L)))\n```\n\n#### Nested Coproducts\n```scala\nsealed trait Inner\ncase class A(x: Int) extends Inner\ncase class B(y: String) extends Inner\n\nsealed trait Outer\ncase class Container(inner: Inner, label: String) extends Outer\n\n// Similar target types with Long instead of Int\nsealed trait InnerV2\ncase class A(x: Long) extends InnerV2\ncase class B(y: String) extends InnerV2\n\nsealed trait OuterV2\ncase class Container(inner: InnerV2, label: String) extends OuterV2\n\nInto[Outer, OuterV2].into(Container(A(42), \"test\"))\n// => Right(Container(A(42L), \"test\"))\n```\n\n#### Collections of Complex Types\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Long)\n\nInto[List[PersonV1], List[PersonV2]].into(\n  List(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30), PersonV1(\"Bob\", 25))\n)\n// => Right(List(PersonV2(\"Alice\", 30L), PersonV2(\"Bob\", 25L)))\n```\n\n#### Nested Collections with Type Conversions\n```scala\ncase class DataV1(values: List[Vector[Int]])\ncase class DataV2(values: Vector[List[Long]])\n\nInto[DataV1, DataV2].into(\n  DataV1(List(Vector(1, 2), Vector(3, 4)))\n)\n// => Right(DataV2(Vector(List(1L, 2L), List(3L, 4L))))\n```\n\n---\n\n## Special Type Support\n\n### Opaque Types (Scala 3)\n\nOpaque types with validation are fully supported. The macro generates runtime validation calls.\n\n```scala\n// Definition with validation\nobject Domain:\n  opaque type Age = Int\n  object Age:\n    def apply(value: Int): Either[String, Age] =\n      if value >= 0 && value <= 150 then Right(value)\n      else Left(s\"Invalid age: $value\")\n    \n    def unsafe(value: Int): Age = value\n    \n    extension (age: Age)\n      def toInt: Int = age\n\n  opaque type Email = String\n  object Email:\n    def apply(value: String): Either[String, Email] =\n      if value.contains(\"@\") then Right(value)\n      else Left(s\"Invalid email: $value\")\n    \n    extension (email: Email)\n      def toString: String = email\n\nimport Domain._\n\n// Usage\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int, email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Age, email: Email)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30, \"alice@example.com\"))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", Age.unsafe(30), Email.unsafe(\"alice@example.com\")))\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", -5, \"alice@example.com\"))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Age validation failed: Invalid age: -5\"))\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30, \"invalid\"))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Email validation failed: Invalid email: invalid\"))\n```\n\n**Macro Behavior**:\n- Detects opaque type companion objects with `apply(underlying): Either[_, OpaqueType]` method\n- Generates validation calls for each opaque type field\n- Accumulates all validation errors using `SchemaError` composition\n- Falls back to direct conversion if no validation method exists\n\n### Newtype Libraries (Scala 2)\n\n#### ZIO Prelude Newtypes (Built-in Support)\n\nThe macro includes hardcoded support for ZIO Prelude newtypes without requiring a compile-time dependency.\n\n```scala\nimport zio.prelude._\n\n// Definition with validation\nobject Domain {\n  object Age extends Subtype[Int] {\n    override def assertion = assert {\n      Assertion.between(0, 150)\n    }\n  }\n  type Age = Age.Type\n\n  object Email extends Newtype[String] {\n    override def assertion = assert {\n      Assertion.matches(\".*@.*\")\n    }\n  }\n  type Email = Email.Type\n}\n\nimport Domain._\n\n// Usage\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int, email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Age, email: Email)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30, \"alice@example.com\"))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", Age(30), Email(\"alice@example.com\")))\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 200, \"invalid\"))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Validation failed: age: 200 is not between 0 and 150, email: invalid does not match .*@.*\"))\n```\n\n**Macro Detection** (no ZIO Prelude dependency required):\n```scala\n// The macro detects ZIO Prelude newtypes by checking:\n// 1. Type extends Newtype[A] or Subtype[A]\n// 2. Companion object exists\n// 3. Has apply/wrap method with validation\n\n// Low-level AST matching in Scala 2 macro:\ndef isZIONewtype(tpe: Type): Boolean = {\n  tpe.typeSymbol.fullName.startsWith(\"zio.prelude.Newtype\") ||\n  tpe.typeSymbol.fullName.startsWith(\"zio.prelude.Subtype\")\n}\n```\n\n#### Other Newtype Libraries\n\nFor other newtype libraries, users can provide explicit `Into` instances. The macro will use these instances when available.\n\n```scala\n// User-provided instance for their newtype library\nimplicit val stringToMyNewtype: Into[String, MyNewtype] = \n  new Into[String, MyNewtype] {\n    def into(s: String): Either[SchemaError, MyNewtype] =\n      MyNewtype.make(s).left.map(e => SchemaError(e.toString))\n  }\n\n// The macro will automatically use this instance\ncase class PersonV1(email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(email: MyNewtype)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"test@example.com\"))\n// Uses the user-provided instance automatically\n```\n\n### Validation Error Accumulation\n\nWhen multiple validations fail, all errors are accumulated using `SchemaError` composition:\n\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int, email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Age, email: Email)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"\", -5, \"invalid\"))\n// => Left(SchemaError(...)) // Combined error containing all validation failures\n```\n\n---\n\n## As[A, B] Additional Requirements\n\nFor `As[A, B]` to be derivable, the bidirectional conversion must be **compatible**:\n\n### Compatibility Rules\n\n1. **Field mappings must be consistent**: The same field correspondence in both directions\n2. **Coercions must be invertible with runtime validation**: \n   - ✅ `Int` ↔ `Long` is valid (narrowing validated at runtime)\n   - ✅ `Float` ↔ `Double` is valid (narrowing validated at runtime)\n   - ✅ All numeric coercions are valid with runtime checks\n3. **Optional fields**: \n   - ✅ Can add optional fields in one direction (becomes `None` in reverse)\n   - ✅ Can remove optional fields in one direction (value is dropped)\n4. **Default values**:\n   - ❌ Cannot use default arguments (breaks round-trip guarantee)\n5. **Collection types**:\n   - ✅ Can convert between different collection types\n   - ⚠️  Set → List → Set may not preserve original order\n   - ⚠️  List → Set → List loses duplicates\n\n### Valid As[A, B] Examples\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Same structure, different names\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(fullName: String, yearsOld: Int)\n\nAs[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", 30))\n\nAs[PersonV1, PersonV2].from(PersonV2(\"Bob\", 25))\n// => Right(PersonV1(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Case class ↔ Tuple\ncase class Point(x: Double, y: Double)\n\nAs[Point, (Double, Double)].into(Point(1.0, 2.0))\n// => Right((1.0, 2.0))\n\nAs[Point, (Double, Double)].from((3.0, 4.0))\n// => Right(Point(3.0, 4.0))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Numeric coercion with runtime validation\ncase class ConfigV1(timeout: Int)\ncase class ConfigV2(timeout: Long)\n\nAs[ConfigV1, ConfigV2].into(ConfigV1(30))\n// => Right(ConfigV2(30L))\n\nAs[ConfigV1, ConfigV2].from(ConfigV2(30L))\n// => Right(ConfigV1(30))\n\nAs[ConfigV1, ConfigV2].from(ConfigV2(3000000000L))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Value 3000000000 exceeds Int.MaxValue\"))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Opaque types (reversible via unwrap)\ncase class PersonRaw(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonValidated(name: String, age: Age)\n\nAs[PersonRaw, PersonValidated].into(PersonRaw(\"Alice\", 30))\n// => Right(PersonValidated(\"Alice\", Age.unsafe(30)))\n\nAs[PersonRaw, PersonValidated].from(PersonValidated(\"Bob\", Age.unsafe(25)))\n// => Right(PersonRaw(\"Bob\", 25))\n\nAs[PersonRaw, PersonValidated].into(PersonRaw(\"Charlie\", -5))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Age validation failed: Invalid age: -5\"))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Collection type conversions\ncase class DataV1(items: List[Int])\ncase class DataV2(items: Vector[Int])\n\nAs[DataV1, DataV2].into(DataV1(List(1, 2, 3)))\n// => Right(DataV2(Vector(1, 2, 3)))\n\nAs[DataV1, DataV2].from(DataV2(Vector(4, 5, 6)))\n// => Right(DataV1(List(4, 5, 6)))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Optional field in one direction\ncase class UserV1(id: String, name: String)\ncase class UserV2(id: String, name: String, email: Option[String])\n\nAs[UserV1, UserV2].into(UserV1(\"123\", \"Alice\"))\n// => Right(UserV2(\"123\", \"Alice\", None))\n\nAs[UserV1, UserV2].from(UserV2(\"456\", \"Bob\", Some(\"bob@example.com\")))\n// => Right(UserV1(\"456\", \"Bob\"))\n// email is dropped in reverse direction\n```\n\n### Non-Ideal As[A, B] Examples (Valid but Lossy)\n\n```scala\n// Valid but lossy: List with duplicates → Set → List\ncase class DataV1(values: List[Int])\ncase class DataV2(values: Set[Int])\n\nAs[DataV1, DataV2].into(DataV1(List(1, 2, 2, 3)))\n// => Right(DataV2(Set(1, 2, 3)))\n\nAs[DataV1, DataV2].from(DataV2(Set(1, 2, 3)))\n// => Right(DataV1(List(1, 2, 3)))\n// Original duplicates are lost, but conversion is valid\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid but lossy: Set → List → Set (order may change)\ncase class DataV1(values: Set[Int])\ncase class DataV2(values: List[Int])\n\nval original = DataV1(Set(3, 1, 2))\nval converted = As[DataV1, DataV2].into(original).right.get\n// converted.values might be List(1, 2, 3) depending on Set iteration order\n\nval roundTrip = As[DataV1, DataV2].from(converted).right.get\n// roundTrip.values == Set(1, 2, 3) - same elements, possibly different internal order\n```\n\n### Invalid As[A, B] Examples\n\n```scala\n// Invalid: Default values break round-trip guarantee\ncase class ProductV1(name: String, price: Double)\ncase class ProductV2(name: String, price: Double, taxable: Boolean = true)\n\n// COMPILE ERROR: Cannot derive As[ProductV1, ProductV2]\n// Reason: Default value for 'taxable' cannot be recovered in reverse direction\n// (We can't distinguish between explicitly set 'true' and default 'true')\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Matrix Dimensions\n\n1. **Type Combinations** (both `Into` and `As`)\n   - Primitive → Primitive (all coercion pairs, including narrowing)\n   - Product → Product (case classes)\n   - Product → Tuple\n   - Tuple → Product\n   - Tuple → Tuple\n   - Coproduct → Coproduct (sealed traits, enums)\n   -

collections\n   - Narrowing conversions (Long → Int with overflow check)\n\n5. **Validation** (Scala 2 ZIO Prelude newtypes)\n   - Newtype validation success\n   - Newtype validation failure\n   -

error)\n   - Overflow in narrowing conversions\n\n9. **Edge Cases**\n   - Empty case classes\n   - Single-field case classes\n   - Case objects\n   - Sealed traits with case objects only\n   - Deeply nested structures (5+ levels)\n   - Large products (20+ fields)\n   - Large coproducts (20+ cases)\n   - Recursive types (e.g., `case class Tree(value: Int, children: List[Tree])`)\n   - Mutually recursive types\n\n### Test Organization\n\n```\nsrc/test/scala/\n  into/\n    products/\n      CaseClassToCaseClassSpec.scala\n      CaseClassToTupleSpec.scala\n      TupleToCaseClassSpec.scala\n

narrowing conversion\ncase class V1(value: Long)\ncase class V2(value: Int)\nassert(Into[V1, V2].into(V1(42L)) == Right(V2(42)))\n\n// Test: Invalid narrowing (overflow)\nassert(Into[V1,

email: Email)\nval result = Into[RawPerson, ValidPerson].into(RawPerson(-5, \"invalid\"))\nassert(result.isLeft)\n// SchemaError contains both validation failures\n```\n\n#### Round-Trip Tests (As)\n\n```scala\n// Test: Case class round-trip\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(fullName: String, yearsOld: Int)\n\nval v1 = PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30)\nval v2 =

ConfigV2].from(config2).right.get\n\nassert(back == config1)\n\n// Test: Numeric narrowing round-trip (overflow failure)\nval config2Overflow = ConfigV2(3000000000L)\nassert(As[ConfigV1,

= As[Data1, Data2].into(data1).right.get\nval backToData1 = As[Data1, Data2].from(data2).right.get\n\nassert(backToData1 == data1)\n\n// Test: Lossy collection round-trip (Set loses duplicates)\ncase class WithDuplicates(items: List[Int])\ncase class NoDuplicates(items: Set[Int])\n\nval original = WithDuplicates(List(1, 2, 2, 3))\nval asSet = As[WithDuplicates, NoDuplicates].into(original).right.get\nval backToList = As[WithDuplicates, NoDuplicates].from(asSet).right.get\n\nassert(asSet.items == Set(1, 2, 3))\nassert(backToList.items.toSet == Set(1, 2, 3)) // Order may differ, duplicates lost\n```\n\n#### Edge Case Tests\n\n```scala\n// Test: Empty case class\ncase class Empty()\nassert(Into[Empty, Empty].into(Empty()) == Right(Empty()))\n\n// Test: Large product (21 fields)\ncase class Large21(f1: Int, f2: Int, /* ... */, f21: Int)\ncase class Large21V2(f1: Long, f2: Long, /* ... */, f21: Long)\n// Must compile and work correctly\n\n// Test:

                  "body": "# Structural Type Schema Support\n\n## Overview\n\nExtend `Schema[A]` to support structural types, enabling schema derivation for types defined by their structure rather than their nominal identity. This allows for duck-typed schema validation and conversion between nominal and structural representations.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Direct Structural Schema Derivation\n\nSchemas can be derived directly for structural types:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 3\ntype Person = { def name: String; def age: Int }\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\n\n// Scala 2\ntype Person = { def name: String; def age: Int }\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\n```\n\n**Note**: Both Scala 2 and Scala 3 use `def` for uniformity, even though Scala 3 supports `val` in structural types.\n\n**Implementation**: Schemas have bindings, which allow construction / deconstruction of values. Values for structural types are backed by:\n- **Scala 3**: `Selectable` \n- **Scala 2**: `Dynamic`\n\n### Nominal to Structural Conversion\n\nConvert nominal type schemas to their structural equivalents:\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Get the structural schema corresponding to Person's shape\nval structuralSchema: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Schema.derived[Person].structural\n```\n\n### Schema API Extension\n\n```scala\ncase class Schema[A](/* existing fields */) {\n  /**\n   * Convert this schema to a structural type schema.\n   * \n   * The structural type represents the \"shape\" of A without its nominal identity.\n   * This enables duck typing and structural validation.\n   * \n   * @param toStructural Macro-generated conversion to structural representation\n   * @return Schema for the structural type corresponding to A\n   */\n  def structural(implicit toStructural: ToStructural[A]): Schema[toStructural.StructuralType] = \n    toStructural.apply(this)\n}\n\n/**\n * Type class for converting nominal schemas to structural schemas.\n * Generated by macro for all supported types. Macro fails if a structural\n * type cannot be generated.\n *\n * NOTE: This approach has to be tested to yield inferrable types, and revised\n * if necessary. Inferrable types (from calling Schema#structural) are a must-have.\n */\ntrait ToStructural[A] {\n  type StructuralType\n  def apply(schema: Schema[A]): Schema[StructuralType]\n}\n\nobject ToStructural {\n  type Aux[A, S] = ToStructural[A] { type StructuralType = S }\n  \n  // Scala 3\n  transparent inline given [A]: ToStructural[A] = ${toStructuralMacro[A]}\n  \n  // Scala 2\n  implicit def materialize[A]: ToStructural[A] = macro toStructuralImpl[A]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n### 1. Simple Product Types\n\n#### Case Class to Structural\n\n```scala\n// Both Scala 2 and Scala 3\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Original nominal schema\nval nominalSchema: Schema[Person] = Schema.derived[Person]\n\n// Convert to structural\nval structuralSchema: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  nominalSchema.structural\n\n// Direct structural derivation (equivalent)\nval directStructural: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Schema.derived[{ def name: String; def age: Int }]\n```\n\n### 2. Nested Structures\n\n```scala\ncase class Address(street: String, city: String, zip: Int)\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int, address: Address)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ \n//   def name: String\n//   def age: Int\n//   def address: { def street: String; def city: String; def zip: Int }\n// }]\n```\n\n### 3. Collections and Options\n\n```scala\ncase class Team(name: String, members: List[String], leader: Option[String])\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Team].structural\n// Type: Schema[{\n//   def name: String\n//   def members: List[String]\n//   def leader: Option[String]\n// }]\n```\n\n### 4. Tuples to Structural\n\n```scala\n// Tuples can be converted to structural types\nval tupleSchema: Schema[(String, Int, Boolean)] = Schema.derived[(String, Int, Boolean)]\n\nval structuralSchema = tupleSchema.structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def _1: String; def _2: Int; def _3: Boolean }]\n```\n\n### 5. Sum Types (Sealed Traits) - Scala 3 Only\n\nSealed traits become union types of structural representations, with tag information stored at the type level:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 3 only\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Result].structural\n// Type: Schema[\n//   { type Tag = \"Success\"; def value: Int } | { type Tag = \"Failure\"; def error: String }\n// ]\n```\n\n**Note**: Sum type to structural conversion is **not supported in Scala 2** because it requires union types. Attempting to call `.structural` on a sealed trait schema in Scala 2 will result in a compile-time error.\n\n### 6. Enums (Scala 3 Only)\n\n```scala\nenum Status:\n  case Active, Inactive, Suspended\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Status].structural\n// Type: Schema[{type Tag = \"Active\"} | {type Tag = \"Inactive\"} | {type Tag = \"Suspended\"}]\n```\n\n### 7. Opaque Types (Scala 3)\n\n```scala\nopaque type UserId = String\nobject UserId:\n  def apply(value: String): Either[String, UserId] = \n    if value.nonEmpty then Right(value) else Left(\"Empty user ID\")\n\ncase class User(id: UserId, name: String)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[User].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def id: String; def name: String }]\n// Opaque type is unwrapped to its underlying type\n```\n\n### 8. Bidirectional Conversion\n\nStructural schemas work seamlessly with `Into`/`As` (if this ticket is implemented **after** that ticket):\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n\n// Create structural value (Scala 3)\nval structuralPerson = new Selectable {\n  def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n    case \"name\" => \"Alice\"\n    case \"age\" => 30\n  }\n}\n\n// Convert structural to nominal using Into\nval person: Either[SchemaError, Person] = \n  Into[{ def name: String; def age: Int }, Person].into(structuralPerson)\n// => Right(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n\n// Convert nominal to structural\nval backToStructural: Either[SchemaError, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Into[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }].into(Person(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n### 9. Empty and Single-Field Products\n\n```scala\n// Empty case class\ncase class Empty()\nval emptyStructural = Schema.derived[Empty].structural\n// Type: Schema[{}]\n\n// Single field\ncase class Id(value: String)\nval idStructural = Schema.derived[Id].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def value: String }]\n```\n\n### 10. Large Products\n\n```scala\ncase class LargeRecord(\n  f1: String, f2: Int, f3: Boolean, f4: Double, f5: Long,\n  f6: String, f7: Int, f8: Boolean, f9: Double, f10: Long,\n  f11: String, f12: Int, f13: Boolean, f14: Double, f15: Long,\n  f16: String, f17: Int, f18: Boolean, f19: Double, f20: Long,\n  f21: String\n)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[LargeRecord].structural\n// Type: Schema[{\n//   def f1: String; def f2: Int; def f3: Boolean; ...\n//   def f21: String\n// }]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Type Name Handling\n\n### Current Limitation\n\nSchemas currently use `TypeName[A]` to identify types. Structural types don't have meaningful nominal type names, which creates a mismatch.\n\n### Temporary Solution\n\nUntil `TypeName[A]` is replaced with `TypeId[A]` (see issue #471), structural schemas will use a normalized string representation of the structural type as a fake type name:\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\nschema.typeName // => TypeName for \"Person\"\n\nval structural = schema.structural\nstructural.typeName // => TypeName for \"{age:Int,name:String}\"\n// Normalized: fields sorted alphabetically, types fully qualified\n```\n\n### Normalization Rules\n\n1. **Field ordering**: Alphabetical by field name\n2. **Type qualification**: Use simple names for primitives and standard library types\n3. **Whitespace**: No whitespace in generated names\n4. **Collections**: Standard notation (e.g., `List[Int]`)\n5. **Options**: Explicit `Option[T]` notation\n6. **Nested structures**: Recursive application of rules\n7. **Deterministic**: Same structure always produces same normalized name\n\n### Examples\n\n```scala\n// Simple product\ncase class Point(x: Int, y: Int)\nSchema.derived[Point].structural.typeName \n// => \"{x:Int,y:Int}\"\n\n// Nested product\ncase class Address(street: String, zip: Int)\ncase class Person(name: String, address: Address)\nSchema.derived[Person].structural.typeName\n// => \"{address:{street:String,zip:Int},name:String}\"\n\n// With collections\ncase class Team(name: String, members: List[String])\nSchema.derived[Team].structural.typeName\n// => \"{members:List[String],name:String}\"\n\n// Union type (Scala 3)\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\nSchema.derived[Result].structural.typeName\n// => \"{error:String}|{value:Int}\"\n```\n\n### Future: TypeId[A]\n\nThe upcoming `TypeId[A]` replacement will properly handle structural types by representing them by their structure rather than a string-based hack. See issue #471 for details.\n\n---\n\n## Limitations and Edge Cases\n\n### 1. Generic Types\n\n**Behavior depends on existing Schema derivation support for generic types.**\n\nIf `Schema.derived[Container[Int]]` already works, then structural conversion should work:\n\n```scala\ncase class Container[T](value: T)\n\n// If this works:\nval schema = Schema.derived[Container[Int]]\n\n// Then this should work:\nval structural = schema.structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def value: Int }]\n```\n\nIf generic type derivation is not currently supported, this ticket **does not require implementing it**. The macro should produce a clear compile-time error for unsupported generic types.\n\n### 2. Recursive Types\n\nRecursive types will **fail at compile-time** because Scala does not support infinite types:\n\n```scala\ncase class Tree(value: Int, children: List[Tree])\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time:\nval structural = Schema.derived[Tree].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate infinite structural type\n\n// The structural type would need to be:\n// { def value: Int; def children: List[{ def value: Int; def children: List[...] }] }\n// which is infinite and unsupported\n```\n\nThe macro must detect recursive types and produce a helpful error message:\n\n```\nCompile error: Cannot generate structural type for recursive type Tree.\nStructural types cannot represent recursive structures.\n```\n\n### 3. Mutually Recursive Types\n\nSimilarly, mutually recursive types are unsupported:\n\n```scala\ncase class Node(id: Int, edges: List[Edge])\ncase class Edge(from: Int, to: Node)\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time:\nval nodeStructural = Schema.derived[Node].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate structural type for mutually recursive types\n```\n\n### 4. Sum Types in Scala 2\n\nSealed traits and sum types **cannot be converted to structural types in Scala 2** because they require union types:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 2\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time in Scala 2:\nval structural = Schema.derived[Result].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate structural type for sum types in Scala 2.\n// Union types are required, which are only available in Scala 3.\n```\n\nThe macro must detect sum types in Scala 2 and produce a clear error.\n\n### 5. Case Objects\n\nCase objects become empty structural types:\n\n```scala\ncase object Singleton\n\nval structural = Schema.derived[Singleton.type].structural\n// Type: Schema[{}]\n```\n\nFor sum types with case objects (Scala 3):\n\n```scala\nsealed trait Status\ncase object Active extends Status\ncase object Inactive extends Status\n\nval structural = Schema.derived[Status].structural\n// Type: Schema[{} | {}]\n// Not particularly useful, but valid\n```\n\n### 6. Structural Types as Source\n\nDeriving schemas directly for structural types is supported:\n\n```scala\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\nval schema = Schema.derived[PersonStructure]\n// Should work if structural type derivation is implemented\n```\n\nThe schema's bindings will use `Selectable` (Scala 3) or `Dynamic` (Scala 2) to construct and deconstruct values.\n\n---\n\n## Integration with Into/As\n\nStructural schemas compose naturally with `Into`/`As` conversions.\n\n### Nominal → Structural\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Auto-derived conversion\nval nominalToStructural: Into[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Into.derived\n\nval person = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\nval structural = nominalToStructural.into(person)\n// => Right(<Selectable/Dynamic instance>)\n```\n\n### Structural → Nominal\n\n```scala\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Auto-derived conversion\nval structuralToNominal: Into[PersonStructure, Person] = \n  Into.derived\n\nval structural: PersonStructure = new Selectable {\n  def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n    case \"name\" => \"Bob\"\n    case \"age\" => 25\n  }\n}\n\nval person = structuralToNominal.into(structural)\n// => Right(Person(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n### Bidirectional (As)\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Bidirectional conversion\nval personAs: As[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  As.derived\n\n// Nominal → Structural\nval structural = personAs.into(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n\n// Structural → Nominal\nval nominal = structural.flatMap(personAs.from)\n// Round-trip successful\n```\n\n### Schema-Guided Conversion\n\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(firstName: String, lastName: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Use structural type as intermediary\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\n// Step 1: Transform V1 to structural (custom logic)\nval v1ToStructural: Into[PersonV1, PersonStructure] = \n  new Into[PersonV1, PersonStructure] {\n    def into(v1: PersonV1): Either[SchemaError, PersonStructure] = {\n      Right(new Selectable {\n        def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n          case \"name\" => s\"${v1.firstName} ${v1.lastName}\"\n          case \"age\" => v1.age\n        }\n      })\n    }\n  }\n\n// Step 2: Auto-convert structural to V2\nval structuralToV2: Into[PersonStructure, PersonV2] = Into.derived\n\n// Composed migration\ndef migrate(v1: PersonV1): Either[SchemaError, PersonV2] = {\n  v1ToStructural.into(v1).flatMap(structuralToV2.into)\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Matrix\n\n1. **Direct Structural Derivation**\n   - Simple products (case classes)\n   - Nested products\n   - Collections (List, Vector, Set, Map, Option, Either)\n   - Tuples (2-22 elements)\n   - Empty case classes\n   - Single-field case classes\n   - Large products (20+ fields)\n   - Case objects\n\n2. **Nominal to Structural Conversion**\n   - Case class → structural\n   - Tuple → structural\n   - Nested case classes → nested structural\n   - Case class with collections → structural with collections\n   - Empty case class → empty structural\n\n3. **Sum Types (Scala 3 Only)**\n   - Sealed trait → union type structural\n   - Sealed trait with case objects\n   - Enum → union type structural\n   - Nested sum types\n\n4. **Type Name Generation**\n   - Simple product normalized name\n   - Nested product normalized name\n   - Name determinism (same structure = same name)\n   - Alphabetical field ordering in names\n   - Union type names (Scala 3)\n\n5. **Selectable/Dynamic Implementation**\n   - Scala 3 Selectable field access\n   - Scala 2 Dynamic field access\n   - Field access correctness\n   - Missing field behavior\n   - Extra field behavior\n\n6. **Integration with Into/As**\n   - Nominal → Structural via Into\n   - Structural → Nominal via Into\n   - Round-trip via As\n   - Composed conversions with structural intermediary\n\n7. **Error Cases (Compile-Time)**\n   - Recursive types produce error\n   - Mutually recursive types produce error\n   - Sum types in Scala 2 produce error\n   - Unsupported types produce helpful errors\n\n8. **Generic Types** (if supported by existing Schema derivation)\n   - Fully applied generic → structural\n   - Generic with nested structural fields\n\n### Scala 2 vs Scala 3 Test Separation\n\n```\nsrc/test/scala/\n  structural/\n    common/\n      SimpleProductSpec.scala\n      NestedProductSpec.scala\n      CollectionsSpec.scala\n      TuplesSpec.scala\n      EmptyProductSpec.scala\n      SingleFieldSpec.scala\n      LargeProductSpec.scala\n      TypeNameNormalizationSpec.scala\n      IntoIntegrationSpec.scala\n      AsIntegrationSpec.scala\n      \n    scala3/\n      UnionTypesSpec.scala\n      SealedTraitToUnionSpec.scala\n      EnumToUnionSpec.scala\n      SelectableImplementationSpec.scala\n      \n    scala2/\n      DynamicImplementationSpec.scala\n      SumTypeErrorSpec.scala (verifies compile error)\n      \n    errors/\n      RecursiveTypeErrorSpec.scala\n      MutualRecursionErrorSpec.scala\n      UnsupportedTypeErrorSpec.scala\n```\n\n### Test Examples\n\n```scala\n// Test: Simple product to structural\ntest(\"case class converts to structural schema\") {\n  case class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n  \n  val structural = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n  \n  // Type check (this is a compile-time test)\n  val _: Schema[{ def name: String;

              "body": "# Structural Type Schema Support\n\n## Overview\n\nExtend `Schema[A]` to support structural types, enabling schema derivation for types defined by their structure rather than their nominal identity. This allows for duck-typed schema validation and conversion between nominal and structural representations.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Direct Structural Schema Derivation\n\nSchemas can be derived directly for structural types:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 3\ntype Person = { def name: String; def age: Int }\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\n\n// Scala 2\ntype Person = { def name: String; def age: Int }\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\n```\n\n**Note**: Both Scala 2 and Scala 3 use `def` for uniformity, even though Scala 3 supports `val` in structural types.\n\n**Implementation**: Schemas have bindings, which allow construction / deconstruction of values. Values for structural types are backed by:\n- **Scala 3**: `Selectable` \n- **Scala 2**: `Dynamic`\n\n### Nominal to Structural Conversion\n\nConvert nominal type schemas to their structural equivalents:\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Get the structural schema corresponding to Person's shape\nval structuralSchema: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Schema.derived[Person].structural\n```\n\n### Schema API Extension\n\n```scala\ncase class Schema[A](/* existing fields */) {\n  /**\n   * Convert this schema to a structural type schema.\n   * \n   * The structural type represents the \"shape\" of A without its nominal identity.\n   * This enables duck typing and structural validation.\n   * \n   * @param toStructural Macro-generated conversion to structural representation\n   * @return Schema for the structural type corresponding to A\n   */\n  def structural(implicit toStructural: ToStructural[A]): Schema[toStructural.StructuralType] = \n    toStructural.apply(this)\n}\n\n/**\n * Type class for converting nominal schemas to structural schemas.\n * Generated by macro for all supported types. Macro fails if a structural\n * type cannot be generated.\n *\n * NOTE: This approach has to be tested to yield inferrable types, and revised\n * if necessary. Inferrable types (from calling Schema#structural) are a must-have.\n */\ntrait ToStructural[A] {\n  type StructuralType\n  def apply(schema: Schema[A]): Schema[StructuralType]\n}\n\nobject ToStructural {\n  type Aux[A, S] = ToStructural[A] { type StructuralType = S }\n  \n  // Scala 3\n  transparent inline given [A]: ToStructural[A] = ${toStructuralMacro[A]}\n  \n  // Scala 2\n  implicit def materialize[A]: ToStructural[A] = macro toStructuralImpl[A]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n### 1. Simple Product Types\n\n#### Case Class to Structural\n\n```scala\n// Both Scala 2 and Scala 3\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Original nominal schema\nval nominalSchema: Schema[Person] = Schema.derived[Person]\n\n// Convert to structural\nval structuralSchema: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  nominalSchema.structural\n\n// Direct structural derivation (equivalent)\nval directStructural: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Schema.derived[{ def name: String; def age: Int }]\n```\n\n### 2. Nested Structures\n\n```scala\ncase class Address(street: String, city: String, zip: Int)\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int, address: Address)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ \n//   def name: String\n//   def age: Int\n//   def address: { def street: String; def city: String; def zip: Int }\n// }]\n```\n\n### 3. Collections and Options\n\n```scala\ncase class Team(name: String, members: List[String], leader: Option[String])\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Team].structural\n// Type: Schema[{\n//   def name: String\n//   def members: List[String]\n//   def leader: Option[String]\n// }]\n```\n\n### 4. Tuples to Structural\n\n```scala\n// Tuples can be converted to structural types\nval tupleSchema: Schema[(String, Int, Boolean)] = Schema.derived[(String, Int, Boolean)]\n\nval structuralSchema = tupleSchema.structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def _1: String; def _2: Int; def _3: Boolean }]\n```\n\n### 5. Sum Types (Sealed Traits) - Scala 3 Only\n\nSealed traits become union types of structural representations, with tag information stored at the type level:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 3 only\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Result].structural\n// Type: Schema[\n//   { type Tag = \"Success\"; def value: Int } | { type Tag = \"Failure\"; def error: String }\n// ]\n```\n\n**Note**: Sum type to structural conversion is **not supported in Scala 2** because it requires union types. Attempting to call `.structural` on a sealed trait schema in Scala 2 will result in a compile-time error.\n\n### 6. Enums (Scala 3 Only)\n\n```scala\nenum Status:\n  case Active, Inactive, Suspended\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Status].structural\n// Type: Schema[{type Tag = \"Active\"} | {type Tag = \"Inactive\"} | {type Tag = \"Suspended\"}]\n```\n\n### 7. Opaque Types (Scala 3)\n\n```scala\nopaque type UserId = String\nobject UserId:\n  def apply(value: String): Either[String, UserId] = \n    if value.nonEmpty then Right(value) else Left(\"Empty user ID\")\n\ncase class User(id: UserId, name: String)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[User].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def id: String; def name: String }]\n// Opaque type is unwrapped to its underlying type\n```\n\n### 8. Bidirectional Conversion\n\nStructural schemas work seamlessly with `Into`/`As` (if this ticket is implemented **after** that ticket):\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n\n// Create structural value (Scala 3)\nval structuralPerson = new Selectable {\n  def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n    case \"name\" => \"Alice\"\n    case \"age\" => 30\n  }\n}\n\n// Convert structural to nominal using Into\nval person: Either[SchemaError, Person] = \n  Into[{ def name: String; def age: Int }, Person].into(structuralPerson)\n// => Right(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n\n// Convert nominal to structural\nval backToStructural: Either[SchemaError, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Into[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }].into(Person(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n### 9. Empty and Single-Field Products\n\n```scala\n// Empty case class\ncase class Empty()\nval emptyStructural = Schema.derived[Empty].structural\n// Type: Schema[{}]\n\n// Single field\ncase class Id(value: String)\nval idStructural = Schema.derived[Id].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def value: String }]\n```\n\n### 10. Large Products\n\n```scala\ncase class LargeRecord(\n  f1: String, f2: Int, f3: Boolean, f4: Double, f5: Long,\n  f6: String, f7: Int, f8: Boolean, f9: Double, f10: Long,\n  f11: String, f12: Int, f13: Boolean, f14: Double, f15: Long,\n  f16: String, f17: Int, f18: Boolean, f19: Double, f20: Long,\n  f21: String\n)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[LargeRecord].structural\n// Type: Schema[{\n//   def f1: String; def f2: Int; def f3: Boolean; ...\n//   def f21: String\n// }]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Type Name Handling\n\n### Current Limitation\n\nSchemas currently use `TypeName[A]` to identify types. Structural types don't have meaningful nominal type names, which creates a mismatch.\n\n### Temporary Solution\n\nUntil `TypeName[A]` is replaced with `TypeId[A]` (see issue #471), structural schemas will use a normalized string representation of the structural type as a fake type name:\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\nschema.typeName // => TypeName for \"Person\"\n\nval structural = schema.structural\nstructural.typeName // => TypeName for \"{age:Int,name:String}\"\n// Normalized: fields sorted alphabetically, types fully qualified\n```\n\n### Normalization Rules\n\n1. **Field ordering**: Alphabetical by field name\n2. **Type qualification**: Use simple names for primitives and standard library types\n3. **Whitespace**: No whitespace in generated names\n4. **Collections**: Standard notation (e.g., `List[Int]`)\n5. **Options**: Explicit `Option[T]` notation\n6. **Nested structures**: Recursive application of rules\n7. **Deterministic**: Same structure always produces same normalized name\n\n### Examples\n\n```scala\n// Simple product\ncase class Point(x: Int, y: Int)\nSchema.derived[Point].structural.typeName \n// => \"{x:Int,y:Int}\"\n\n// Nested product\ncase class Address(street: String, zip: Int)\ncase class Person(name: String, address: Address)\nSchema.derived[Person].structural.typeName\n// => \"{address:{street:String,zip:Int},name:String}\"\n\n// With collections\ncase class Team(name: String, members: List[String])\nSchema.derived[Team].structural.typeName\n// => \"{members:List[String],name:String}\"\n\n// Union type (Scala 3)\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\nSchema.derived[Result].structural.typeName\n// => \"{error:String}|{value:Int}\"\n```\n\n### Future: TypeId[A]\n\nThe upcoming `TypeId[A]` replacement will properly handle structural types by representing them by their structure rather than a string-based hack. See issue #471 for details.\n\n---\n\n## Limitations and Edge Cases\n\n### 1. Generic Types\n\n**Behavior depends on existing Schema derivation support for generic types.**\n\nIf `Schema.derived[Container[Int]]` already works, then structural conversion should work:\n\n```scala\ncase class Container[T](value: T)\n\n// If this works:\nval schema = Schema.derived[Container[Int]]\n\n// Then this should work:\nval structural = schema.structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def value: Int }]\n```\n\nIf generic type derivation is not currently supported, this ticket **does not require implementing it**. The macro should produce a clear compile-time error for unsupported generic types.\n\n### 2. Recursive Types\n\nRecursive types will **fail at compile-time** because Scala does not support infinite types:\n\n```scala\ncase class Tree(value: Int, children: List[Tree])\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time:\nval structural = Schema.derived[Tree].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate infinite structural type\n\n// The structural type would need to be:\n// { def value: Int; def children: List[{ def value: Int; def children: List[...] }] }\n// which is infinite and unsupported\n```\n\nThe macro must detect recursive types and produce a helpful error message:\n\n```\nCompile error: Cannot generate structural type for recursive type Tree.\nStructural types cannot represent recursive structures.\n```\n\n### 3. Mutually Recursive Types\n\nSimilarly, mutually recursive types are unsupported:\n\n```scala\ncase class Node(id: Int, edges: List[Edge])\ncase class Edge(from: Int, to: Node)\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time:\nval nodeStructural = Schema.derived[Node].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate structural type for mutually recursive types\n```\n\n### 4. Sum Types in Scala 2\n\nSealed traits and sum types **cannot be converted to structural types in Scala 2** because they require union types:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 2\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time in Scala 2:\nval structural = Schema.derived[Result].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate structural type for sum types in Scala 2.\n// Union types are required, which are only available in Scala 3.\n```\n\nThe macro must detect sum types in Scala 2 and produce a clear error.\n\n### 5. Case Objects\n\nCase objects become empty structural types:\n\n```scala\ncase object Singleton\n\nval structural = Schema.derived[Singleton.type].structural\n// Type: Schema[{}]\n```\n\nFor sum types with case objects (Scala 3):\n\n```scala\nsealed trait Status\ncase object Active extends Status\ncase object Inactive extends Status\n\nval structural = Schema.derived[Status].structural\n// Type: Schema[{} | {}]\n// Not particularly useful, but valid\n```\n\n### 6. Structural Types as Source\n\nDeriving schemas directly for structural types is supported:\n\n```scala\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\nval schema = Schema.derived[PersonStructure]\n// Should work if structural type derivation is implemented\n```\n\nThe schema's bindings will use `Selectable` (Scala 3) or `Dynamic` (Scala 2) to construct and deconstruct values.\n\n---\n\n## Integration with Into/As\n\nStructural schemas compose naturally with `Into`/`As` conversions.\n\n### Nominal → Structural\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Auto-derived conversion\nval nominalToStructural: Into[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Into.derived\n\nval person = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\nval structural = nominalToStructural.into(person)\n// => Right(<Selectable/Dynamic instance>)\n```\n\n### Structural → Nominal\n\n```scala\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Auto-derived conversion\nval structuralToNominal: Into[PersonStructure, Person] = \n  Into.derived\n\nval structural: PersonStructure = new Selectable {\n  def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n    case \"name\" => \"Bob\"\n    case \"age\" => 25\n  }\n}\n\nval person = structuralToNominal.into(structural)\n// => Right(Person(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n### Bidirectional (As)\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Bidirectional conversion\nval personAs: As[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  As.derived\n\n// Nominal → Structural\nval structural = personAs.into(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n\n// Structural → Nominal\nval nominal = structural.flatMap(personAs.from)\n// Round-trip successful\n```\n\n### Schema-Guided Conversion\n\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(firstName: String, lastName: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Use structural type as intermediary\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\n// Step 1: Transform V1 to structural (custom logic)\nval v1ToStructural: Into[PersonV1, PersonStructure] = \n  new Into[PersonV1, PersonStructure] {\n    def into(v1: PersonV1): Either[SchemaError, PersonStructure] = {\n      Right(new Selectable {\n        def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n          case \"name\" => s\"${v1.firstName} ${v1.lastName}\"\n          case \"age\" => v1.age\n        }\n      })\n    }\n  }\n\n// Step 2: Auto-convert structural to V2\nval structuralToV2: Into[PersonStructure, PersonV2] = Into.derived\n\n// Composed migration\ndef migrate(v1: PersonV1): Either[SchemaError, PersonV2] = {\n  v1ToStructural.into(v1).flatMap(structuralToV2.into)\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Matrix\n\n1. **Direct Structural Derivation**\n   - Simple products (case classes)\n   - Nested products\n   - Collections (List, Vector, Set, Map, Option, Either)\n   - Tuples (2-22 elements)\n   - Empty case classes\n   - Single-field case classes\n   - Large products (20+ fields)\n   - Case objects\n\n2. **Nominal to Structural Conversion**\n   - Case class → structural\n   - Tuple → structural\n   - Nested case classes → nested structural\n   - Case class with collections → structural with collections\n   - Empty case class → empty structural\n\n3. **Sum Types (Scala 3 Only)**\n   - Sealed trait → union type structural\n   - Sealed trait with case objects\n   - Enum → union type structural\n   - Nested sum types\n\n4. **Type Name Generation**\n   - Simple product normalized name\n   - Nested product normalized name\n   - Name determinism (same structure = same name)\n   - Alphabetical field ordering in names\n   - Union type names (Scala 3)\n\n5. **Selectable/Dynamic Implementation**\n   - Scala 3 Selectable field access\n   - Scala 2 Dynamic field access\n   - Field access correctness\n   - Missing field behavior\n   - Extra field behavior\n\n6. **Integration with Into/As**\n   - Nominal → Structural via Into\n   - Structural → Nominal via Into\n   - Round-trip via As\n   - Composed conversions with structural intermediary\n\n7. **Error Cases (Compile-Time)**\n   - Recursive types produce error\n   - Mutually recursive types produce error\n   - Sum types in Scala 2 produce error\n   - Unsupported types produce helpful errors\n\n8. **Generic Types** (if supported by existing Schema derivation)\n   - Fully applied generic → structural\n   - Generic with nested structural fields\n\n### Scala 2 vs Scala 3 Test Separation\n\n```\nsrc/test/scala/\n  structural/\n    common/\n      SimpleProductSpec.scala\n      NestedProductSpec.scala\n      CollectionsSpec.scala\n      TuplesSpec.scala\n      EmptyProductSpec.scala\n      SingleFieldSpec.scala\n      LargeProductSpec.scala\n      TypeNameNormalizationSpec.scala\n      IntoIntegrationSpec.scala\n      AsIntegrationSpec.scala\n      \n    scala3/\n      UnionTypesSpec.scala\n      SealedTraitToUnionSpec.scala\n      EnumToUnionSpec.scala\n      SelectableImplementationSpec.scala\n      \n    scala2/\n      DynamicImplementationSpec.scala\n      SumTypeErrorSpec.scala (verifies compile error)\n      \n    errors/\n      RecursiveTypeErrorSpec.scala\n      MutualRecursionErrorSpec.scala\n      UnsupportedTypeErrorSpec.scala\n```\n\n### Test Examples\n\n```scala\n// Test: Simple product to structural\ntest(\"case class converts to structural schema\") {\n  case class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n  \n  val structural = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n  \n  // Type check (this is a compile-time test)\n  val _: Schema[{ def name: String;

The system provides a typed API (`Patch[A]`) built on an untyped core (`DynamicPatch`) that operates on `DynamicValue`.\n\nBelow is a rough outline or sketch of the design of patching & diffing, subject to revision by the implementor based on technical feasibility considerations.\n\n## Core Architecture\n\n### Type Hierarchy\n\n```scala\n// Typed patch (user-facing API)\ncase class Patch[A](dynamicPatch: DynamicPatch, schema: Schema[A]) {\n  /** Apply patch with specified mode */\n  def apply(value: A, mode: PatchMode = PatchMode.Strict): Either[SchemaError, A]\n  \n  /** Compose patches sequentially (monoid operation) */\n  def ++(that: Patch[A]): Patch[A]\n}\n\n// Untyped patch (operates on DynamicValue)\ncase class DynamicPatch(ops: Vector[DynamicPatchOp]) {\n  /** Apply to dynamic value */\n  def apply(value: DynamicValue, mode: PatchMode): Either[SchemaError, DynamicValue]\n  \n  /** Compose patches */\n  def ++(that: DynamicPatch): DynamicPatch\n}\n```\n\n### Operations\n\n```scala\ncase class DynamicPatchOp(optic: DynamicOptic, operation: Operation)\n\nsealed trait Operation\nobject Operation {\n  case class Set(value: DynamicValue) extends Operation\n  case class PrimitiveDelta(op: PrimitiveOp) extends Operation\n  case class SequenceEdit(ops: Vector[SeqOp]) extends Operation\n  case class MapEdit(ops: Vector[MapOp]) extends Operation\n}\n```\n\n## Typed API\n\nAll typed operations live in `Patch` companion object:\n\n```scala\nobject Patch {\n  /** Empty patch (monoid identity) */\n  def empty[A](implicit schema: Schema[A]): Patch[A]\n  \n  /** Set a field/element to a value (clobber semantics) */\n  def set[S, A](optic: Optic[S, A], value: A)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  \n  /** Increment numeric field */\n  def increment[S](optic: Optic[S, Int], delta: Int)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def incrementLong[S](optic: Optic[S, Long], delta: Long)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def incrementDouble[S](optic: Optic[S, Double], delta: Double)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  \n  /** Edit string field */\n  def editString[S](optic: Optic[S, String], edits:

\n  /** Skip operations that fail preconditions */\n  case object Lenient extends PatchMode\n  \n  /** Replace/overwrite on conflicts */\n  case object Clobber extends PatchMode\n}\n```\n\n## Schema

diff(oldValue: A, newValue: A): Patch[A]\n  \n  /** Convenience method - apply patch with Strict mode */\n  def patch(value: A, patch: Patch[A]): Either[SchemaError, A] =\n    patch.apply(value, PatchMode.Strict)\n}\n```\n\n## Diffing Strategy\n\nThe `Schema#diff` implementation uses smart heuristics:\n\n1. **New elements/keys**: Use `Operation.Set` \n   - Sequence insertions at new indices\n   - Map additions for new keys\n   - Sum type switches to different cases\n\n2. **String modifications**: Use `StringEdit` if edit sequence is shorter than new string, otherwise use `Set`\n\n3. **Numeric modifications**: Use delta operations (`IntDelta`, etc.)\n\n4. **Structural modifications**: Recursively diff nested structures, using field-level patches for records\n\n5. **Temporal modifications**: Use temporal delta operations for date/time types\n\n## Laws\n\n### Roundtrip Law\nFor all values, the following must hold:\n```scala\n∀ (schema: Schema[A], old: A, new: A).\n  schema.diff(old, new).apply(old) == Right(new)\n```\n\n### Monoid Laws\n```scala\n// Identity (empty patch)\n∀ (p: Patch[A]). \n  p ++ Patch.empty == p\n  Patch.empty ++ p == p\n\n// Associativity\n∀ (p1: Patch[A], p2: Patch[A], p3: Patch[A]).\n  (p1 ++ p2) ++ p3 == p1 ++ (p2 ++ p3)\n```\n\n### Serializability\nAll patch types are pure data (DynamicValue, DynamicOptic, primitives) and must be serializable:\n```scala\n∀ (p: Patch[A]). \n  jsonCodec.decode(jsonCodec.encode(p)) == Right(p)\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- `Operation.Set` uses `DynamicValue` to represent whole values for materialization cases\n- `Patch[A]` converts typed values to `DynamicValue` via `Schema[A]` before applying `DynamicPatch` constructor\n- String edits use LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) algorithm\n- Sequence edits also use LCS for computing minimal insert/delete sequences\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] `DynamicPatch` defined with all operation types, capable of transforming one DynamicValue to another in the most minimal possible way\n- [ ] `Patch[A]` wraps `DynamicPatch` with an additional `Schema[A]`\n- [ ] Typed API in `Patch` companion object for all common operations\n- [ ] `Schema#diff` implements smart diffing strategy\n- [ ] `PatchMode` controls patch application behavior\n- [ ] All fallible operations return `Either[SchemaError, A]` so error information is preserved\n- [ ] Roundtrip law holds for all schema types\n- [ ] Monoid laws hold for patch composition\n- [ ] All patch types serialize/deserialize correctly (except `Patch` itself, which cannot be serialized unless `Schema` is serialized, which in the general case requires a `TypeRegistry`)\n- [ ] String diffs use LCS algorithm\n- [ ] Sequence diffs use LCS algorithm\n- [ ] Comprehensive tests for all operation types, and for serialization of non-`Patch` types such as DynamicPatch and everything it contains\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```scala\n@schema \n@optics\ncase class Person(name: String,

The system provides a typed API (`Patch[A]`) built on an untyped core (`DynamicPatch`) that operates on `DynamicValue`.\n\nBelow is a rough outline or sketch of the design of patching & diffing, subject to revision by the implementor based on technical feasibility considerations.\n\n## Core Architecture\n\n### Type Hierarchy\n\n```scala\n// Typed patch (user-facing API)\ncase class Patch[A](dynamicPatch: DynamicPatch, schema: Schema[A]) {\n  /** Apply patch with specified mode */\n  def apply(value: A, mode: PatchMode = PatchMode.Strict): Either[SchemaError, A]\n  \n  /** Compose patches sequentially (monoid operation) */\n  def ++(that: Patch[A]): Patch[A]\n}\n\n// Untyped patch (operates on DynamicValue)\ncase class DynamicPatch(ops: Vector[DynamicPatchOp]) {\n  /** Apply to dynamic value */\n  def apply(value: DynamicValue, mode: PatchMode): Either[SchemaError, DynamicValue]\n  \n  /** Compose patches */\n  def ++(that: DynamicPatch): DynamicPatch\n}\n```\n\n### Operations\n\n```scala\ncase class DynamicPatchOp(optic: DynamicOptic, operation: Operation)\n\nsealed trait Operation\nobject Operation {\n  case class Set(value: DynamicValue) extends Operation\n  case class PrimitiveDelta(op: PrimitiveOp) extends Operation\n  case class SequenceEdit(ops: Vector[SeqOp]) extends Operation\n  case class MapEdit(ops: Vector[MapOp]) extends Operation\n}\n```\n\n## Typed API\n\nAll typed operations live in `Patch` companion object:\n\n```scala\nobject Patch {\n  /** Empty patch (monoid identity) */\n  def empty[A](implicit schema: Schema[A]): Patch[A]\n  \n  /**

                  "body": "# Overview\n\nThis ticket involves adding two annotation macros for Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.5+. These annotation macros will add new definitions in the companion object of the trait / class / enum to which they are applied.\n\nThe annotation macros are as follows:\n\n - `@optic`: Adds optics for all terms of the record / enum inside the companion object. Comes in an optional variant, called `@optics_`, which prefixes all optics with an underscore character (`_`) to avoid name collisions. The names of these optics are the same as the term names, except for sum term names, the first letter is lower-cased to avoid colliding with the object of the same name in the same scope.\n - `@schema`: Adds an `implicit` / `given` schema for the record / enum inside the companion object, with the name `<xyz>Schema`, e.g. `personSchema`.\n\n**Note 1**: In the ideal case, applying `@optics` to a sealed trait or enum would result in optics being added to the companion objects of the subtypes of the sealed trait / enum.\n\n## Optics\n### Case Class\n####

              "body": "# Overview\n\nThis ticket involves adding two annotation macros for Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.5+. These annotation macros will add new definitions in the companion object of the trait / class / enum to which they are applied.\n\nThe annotation macros are as follows:\n\n - `@optic`: Adds optics for all terms of the record / enum inside the companion object. Comes in an optional variant, called `@optics_`, which prefixes all optics with an underscore character (`_`) to avoid name collisions. The names of these optics are the same as the term names, except for sum term names, the first letter is lower-cased to avoid colliding with the object of the same name in the same scope.\n - `@schema`: Adds an `implicit` / `given` schema for the record / enum inside the companion object, with the name `<xyz>Schema`, e.g. `personSchema`.\n\n**Note 1**: In the ideal case, applying `@optics` to a sealed trait or enum would result in optics being added to the companion objects of the subtypes of the sealed trait / enum.\n\n## Optics\n### Case Class\n####

In `parseDockerComposeFile()` for the Application model (around line 2066), add:\n   ```php\n   $isDatabase = isDatabaseImage($image, $service);\n   data_set($service, 'is_database', $isDatabase);\n   ```\n\n2.
