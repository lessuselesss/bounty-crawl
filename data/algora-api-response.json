In `parseDockerComposeFile()` for the Application model (around line 2066), add:\n   ```php\n   $isDatabase = isDatabaseImage($image, $service);\n   data_set($service, 'is_database', $isDatabase);\n   ```\n\n2.

              "body": "\n### Description: \n> GitHub Enterprise 2.8.x before 2.8.7 contains a deserialization caused by a static enterprise session secret in the Management Console, letting unauthenticated attackers execute arbitrary code, exploit requires crafting a signed cookie with the secret.\n\n#### Severity: `Critical`\n\n#### POC: \n- https://www.exablue.de/blog/2017-03-15-github-enterprise-remote-code-execution.html\n- https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/linux/http/github_enterprise_secret.rb\n\n### KEV: True\n\n### Shodan Query: `http.title:\"github debug\"`\n\n> Acceptance Criteria: The template must include a complete POC and should not rely solely on version-based detection. Contributors are required to provide debug data(`-debug`) along with the template to help the triage team with validation or can also share a vulnerable environment like docker file. \n\n> Rewards will only be given once the template is fully validated by the team. Templates that are incomplete or invalid will not be accepted. Avoid adding code templates for CVEs that can be achieved using HTTP, TCP, or JavaScript. Such templates are blocked by default and won’t produce results, so we prioritize creating templates with other protocols unless exceptions are made.\n\nYou can check the FAQ for the Nuclei Templates Community Rewards Program [here](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/main/Community-Rewards-FAQ.md).\n",
