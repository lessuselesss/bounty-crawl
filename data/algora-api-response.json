              "body": "#### Description of requested feature:\nMudlet is a Qt Widgets based application, which works great for Linux/macOS/Windows, but not so great for running natively on Android or iPhone, which are popular feature requests.\n\nAkin to how VLC is split into libVLC and various front-ends, split Mudlet out into libmudlet (providing all of core functionality) and a Qt Widget frontend that makes use of all of the core functionality.\n\n**Prior to taking this issue up**, open a new github issue here and in there, provide (1) plan for how the library/frontend split will work on an architectural level, and (2) a plan for the migration strategy, since once mega PR will not work for this.\n\n#### Reasons for adding feature:\n\n1. allowing Mudlet to eventually have a mobile-native version\n\n#### Expected result of feature\nlibmudlet may use Qt Core classes (QObject, QTimer, QThread, QSettings, etc.) but must not depend on Qt Widgets, Qt GUI, or any UI-related Qt modules.\n\n Mudlet's functionality pre and post-split should be 100% the same, nothing should be lost in the transition:\n -  All existing automated tests must pass, plus:\n  - All menu items and dialogs function identically\n  - All Lua API functions return identical results\n  - All protocol features work (GMCP, MXP, etc.)\n  - All file formats (profiles, packages) remain compatible\n\nPerformance of the network/text display stack as well as the trigger engine should be comparable as well (no more than 10% lost). Measured in:\n\n  - Text display: X lines/second in main console (can be measured using [stressinator](https://packages.mudlet.org/packages#pkg-Stressinator))\n  - Network: Y MB/s processing throughput (needs to be measured)\n  - Memory: no more than 10% increase in base memory usage\n\n####\n\n",

Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",

Measured in:\n\n  - Text display: X lines/second in main console (can be measured using [stressinator](https://packages.mudlet.org/packages#pkg-Stressinator))\n  - Network: Y MB/s processing throughput (needs to be measured)\n  - Memory: no more than 10% increase in base memory usage\n\n####\n\n",

Measured in:\n\n  - Text display: X lines/second in main console (can be measured using [stressinator](https://packages.mudlet.org/packages#pkg-Stressinator))\n  - Network: Y MB/s processing throughput (needs to be measured)\n  - Memory: no more than 10% increase in base memory usage\n\n####\n\n",
