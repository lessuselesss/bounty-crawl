This means automated backups are not available for databases in these deployments.\n\nHowever, when using \"Empty Docker Compose\" or one-click services (like Supabase), database detection works correctly and backups are available.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\n| Deployment Method | Model | Creates ServiceDatabase | Backups Available |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Empty Docker Compose | `Service` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |\n| GitHub App (dockercompose buildpack) | `Application` | ❌ No | ❌ No |\n| One-click Services (e.g., Supabase) | `Service` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nDatabase services in Docker Compose files deployed via GitHub App should be detected and have backup functionality available, similar to Empty Docker Compose deployments.\n\n### Technical Details\n\nThe issue is in `bootstrap/helpers/shared.php` in the `parseDockerComposeFile()` function:\n\n**Service model path (lines 1263-2025):**\n- Calls `isDatabaseImage()` to detect databases\n- Creates `ServiceDatabase` records for detected databases\n- These databases can have scheduled backups\n\n**Application model path (lines 2026-2767):**\n- Does NOT call `isDatabaseImage()`\n- Does NOT create `ServiceDatabase` records\n- All services are treated as application containers\n- No backup support\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nAdd database detection logic to the Application model parsing path:\n\n1. In `parseDockerComposeFile()` for the Application model (around line 2066), add:\n   ```php\n   $isDatabase = isDatabaseImage($image, $service);\n   data_set($service, 'is_database', $isDatabase);\n   ```\n\n2.

There is no configuration to turn this on or off with ease, or even commented out docker-compose, nor any notes.\n2. With how we expose Kong via URL by default, the approach in the document could be messy or unsafe\n3. It looks like additional configuration may be required if there are multiple Supabase instances on the same server with individual /mcp exposures as Traefik is handling the routing and everything is using the same ports, etc...\n\n**I am looking for a \"work around\" as the resolution for this bounty.** That is acceptable, but I will require **at minimum a tutorial below** that figures out how to get around this bug/issue and properly documents the following:\n\n- How to configure the MCP and use it on local network\n- How to setup Wireguard to properly allow for usage of this MCP\n- How to configure Cursor/Claude Code/Windsurf to use this MCP\n- **MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOW TO CONNECT TO DIFFERENT SUPABASE INSTANCES ON THE SAME COOLIFY INSTANCE (assuming all of them are running the default Service template)**\n\nCreating a fix within the system we have to spin up and manage a Supabase instance may be difficult due to the template system's restraints, but if you want to work on that complaint of mine and **earn much more than $15**, you can see the bottom of this post. I list off the other bounties I will be offering and putting up cash for upon clearing some wires and hopefully seeing someone (or a few people) dedicate time to it.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Follow docs linked above\n2.

There is no configuration to turn this on or off with ease, or even commented out docker-compose, nor any notes.\n2. With how we expose Kong via URL by default, the approach in the document could be messy or unsafe\n3. It looks like additional configuration may be required if there are multiple Supabase instances on the same server with individual /mcp exposures as Traefik is handling the routing and everything is using the same ports, etc...\n\n**I am looking for a \"work around\" as the resolution for this bounty.** That is acceptable, but I will require **at minimum a tutorial below** that figures out how to get around this bug/issue and properly documents the following:\n\n- How to configure the MCP and use it on local network\n- How to setup Wireguard to properly allow for usage of this MCP\n- How to configure Cursor/Claude Code/Windsurf to use this MCP\n- **MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOW TO CONNECT TO DIFFERENT SUPABASE INSTANCES ON THE SAME COOLIFY INSTANCE (assuming all of them are running the default Service template)**\n\nCreating a fix within the system we have to spin up and manage a Supabase instance may be difficult due to the template system's restraints, but if you want to work on that complaint of mine and **earn much more than $15**, you can see the bottom of this post.

To support any size database we should investigate enhancements to allow any sized database to be exported. Currently the size limitations are 1GB for Durable Objects with 10GB in the future. Operate under the assumption that we might be attempting to dump a 10GB database into a `.sql` file.\n\nAnother consideration to make is because Durable Objects execute synchronous operations we may need to allow for \"breathing intervals\". An example might be we allow our export operation to run for 5 seconds, and take 5 seconds off if other requests are in a queue, then it can pick up again. The goal here would be to prevent locking the database for long periods of time.\n\nBut then poses the questions: \n1. How do we continue operations that need more than 30 seconds to work?\n2. Where is the data stored as it's being created? (R2, S3, something else)?\n3. How do we deliver that dump information to the user after its completed?\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Hit the `/export/dump` endpoint on a large database\n2. Will eventually fail when the 30 second request response time window closes\n\nRun the following command in Terminal (replace the URL with yours) and if your operation exceeds 30 seconds you should see a failed network response instead of a dump file.\n```\ncurl --location 'https://starbasedb.YOUR-ID-HERE.workers.dev/export/dump' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' \\\n--output database_dump.sql\n```\n\nIf you can't create a large enough test database feel free to add code in to `sleep` for 29 seconds before proceeding with the `/export/dump` functional code and should also see the failure.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nAs a user I would expect any and all of the specified data to be dumped out without an error and without partial results. Where it ends up for the user to access if the operation takes more than 30 seconds is up for discussion. Ideally if shorter than 30 seconds it could be returned as our cURL above works today (downloads the file from the response of the origin request), but perhaps after the timeout it continues on uploads it to a destination source to access afterwards?\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n1. For backups require an R2 binding\n2. Have a `.sql` file that gets created in R2 with the filename like `dump_20240101-170000.sql` where it represents `2024-01-01 17:00:00`\n3. Create the file and continuously append new chunks to it until reaching the end\n4. May need to utilize a DO alarm to continue the work after X time if a timeout occurs & mark where it currently is in the process in internal memory so it can pick up and continue.\n5. Provide a callback URL when the operation is finally completed so users can create custom logic to notify them (e.g. Email, Slack, etc)",

Will eventually fail when the 30 second request response time window closes\n\nRun the following command in Terminal (replace the URL with yours) and if your operation exceeds 30 seconds you should see a failed network response instead of a dump file.\n```\ncurl --location 'https://starbasedb.YOUR-ID-HERE.workers.dev/export/dump' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' \\\n--output database_dump.sql\n```\n\nIf you can't create a large enough test database feel free to add code in to `sleep` for 29 seconds before proceeding with the `/export/dump` functional code and should also see the failure.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nAs a user I would expect any and all of the specified data to be dumped out without an error and without partial results. Where it ends up for the user to access if the operation takes more than 30 seconds is up for discussion. Ideally if shorter than 30 seconds it could be returned as our cURL above works today (downloads the file from the response of the origin request), but perhaps after the timeout it continues on uploads it to a destination source to access afterwards?\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n1. For backups require an R2 binding\n2. Have a `.sql` file that gets created in R2 with the filename like `dump_20240101-170000.sql` where it represents `2024-01-01 17:00:00`\n3. Create the file and continuously append new chunks to it until reaching the end\n4. May need to utilize a DO alarm to continue the work after X time if a timeout occurs & mark where it currently is in the process in internal memory so it can pick up and continue.\n5. Provide a callback URL when the operation is finally completed so users can create custom logic to notify them (e.g. Email, Slack, etc)",
