We were seeing websockets disconnect errors in the clients, but no errors server side, so no clues it was the broadcast URI. \r\n\r\nAfter turning debug logging on for the server, I spotted the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.018085+0000| fastapi_websocket_rpc.websocket_rpc_e...| INFO  | Client connected\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.018500+0000| websockets.legacy.server                | INFO  | connection open\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.022749+0000| fastapi_websocket_rpc.rpc_channel       |DEBUG  | Handling RPC request - {'request': RpcRequest(method='_ping_', arguments={}, call_id='5d8d421e3dc94751a035b202644c8e8a'), 'channel': '72c2a547ffc64741bd095079bc778d7d'}\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.023420+0000| fastapi_websocket_pubsub.pub_sub_server |DEBUG  | task is done: {<Task finished name='Task-3053' coro=<EventBroadcaster.__read_notifications__() done, defined at /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/fastapi_websocket_pubsub/event_broadcaster.py:245> exception=gaierror(-2, 'Name or service not known')>}\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.023565+0000| fastapi_websocket_pubsub.event_broadc...| INFO  | Cancelling broadcast listen task\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.023677+0000| fastapi_websocket_pubsub.event_broadc...|DEBUG  | Unsubscribing from ALL TOPICS\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.023790+0000| fastapi_websocket_pubsub.event_notifier |DEBUG  | Removing Subscription of topic='__EventNotifier_ALL_TOPICS__' for subscriber=cc43be7c3ebb41e1b4869ace10d213db\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.023948+0000| fastapi_websocket_rpc.websocket_rpc_e...| INFO  | Client connection failed - 42723 :: 72c2a547ffc64741bd095079bc778d7d\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.024165+0000| fastapi_websocket_pubsub.pub_sub_server |DEBUG  | Leaving endpoint's main loop\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.026785+0000| websockets.legacy.server                | INFO  | connection closed\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on the 4th line, I went to look at `fastapi_websocket_pubsub/event_broadcaster.py:245` and saw it was referencing the broadcast URI, at which point I double checked ours and saw the typo. \r\n\r\nWhat I believe to be a bug is that the error is being swallowed, and should probably be elevated to an `ERROR` level log for visibility.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSet the broadcast URI to an invalid value - in our case, a postgres URI with a hostname that didn't resolve.\r\n\r\nLogs: [se616-opal-opal-server-545c454db-hx2nc.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18010731/se616-opal-opal-server-545c454db-hx2nc.log)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA clear error level log to indicate that the broadcast URI could not be resolved\r\n\r\n**OPAL version**\r\n - Version: Client - 0.7.15, Server - 0.7.8\r\n",
