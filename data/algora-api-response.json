              "body": "$2000 USD Bounty here!\n\nIf you can find a nice solution to our local dev experience, take home a $2000 USD bounty. We have a very strong feeling the culprit is the App Store. The problem is that refactoring it is a challenge since we have 100+ apps, there are tons of circular dependencies and our `main` branch is constantly merged to, making conflicts hard to work around.\n\nTake these PRs as inspiration to ideally not load the entire App Store upon any given page load in our app. If you debug locally and watch what happens in the `.next/server/chunks` folder, you will see it's compiling a ton of code that's not needed.\n\nThese PRs have gotten close but refactoring the test suite to continue passing has been quite a blocker.\n\nhttps://github.com/calcom/cal.com/pull/22450 - EDIT 2025-08-17 This is being brought back to life with the help of @joeauyeung to fix the test suite.\nhttps://github.com/calcom/cal.com/pull/19771\n\nCurrent initial page load times per page even on a beast MacBook Pro can be upwards of 10-12s. **This needs to be cut by at least 80%.**",

This is making it so I can't use the integration.\r\n\r\nWe also use Fastmail and have been seeing some oddities with the [cal.com](http://cal.com/) integration. Namely, that participants are receiving multiple calendar invites, which on it's own isn't that big of a deal. However, the Fastmail invites are always in UTC, not in the local time of the cal.com invite.\r\n\r\nThis is creating a lot of confusion with participants, they keep missing our meetings, not realizing one invite is UTC and one in local time. I spoke with the Fastmail team and they relayed the following notes about cal's specific integration.\r\n\r\n1. There is a property (SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT) a CalDAV client can add to the event that would prevent CalDAV servers from sending invitations. It appears cal.com is not setting this property even though they are sending an invitation.\r\n2. The invitation being sent by [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is using a different UID. Basically every event has a UID that uniquely identifies the event. Since [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is sending the invitation of the event with a different UID, if you end up adding this event to your calendar [cal.com](http://cal.com/), it will create a duplicate event in your calendar as well. They need to fix it so that all emails associated with a single event use the same original UID.\r\n3. The event added from [cal.com](http://cal.com/) doesn't have a timezone associated with it. Though it mentions the invitees timezone as \"America/Chicago\" in the notes, the event itself doesn't include a timezone and only specifies the time in UTC. Since the event time is specified in UTC, Fastmail's invitation email will also be sent in UTC.\r\n4. There seems to be no way to stop Cal.com from creating the calendar events at all, and thus no real workaround.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Connect to Fastmail using CalDav integration\r\n2. Create a test booking\r\n3. See issues above.\r\n\r\nAny other relevant information. For example, why do you consider this a bug and what did you expect to happen instead?\r\n1. SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT should be set, so Fastmail knows not to send an invitation. **This is the main one.**\r\n2. UID should be unique per event.\r\n3. Event time should have a timezone associated with it.\r\n4. An option could be added to make calendar event creation optional (nice-to-have, not essential).\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\n\r\nNone other than Fastmail/CalDAV.",
