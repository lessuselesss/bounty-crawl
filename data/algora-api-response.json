Measured in:\n\n  - Text display: X lines/second in main console (can be measured using [stressinator](https://packages.mudlet.org/packages#pkg-Stressinator))\n  - Network: Y MB/s processing throughput (needs to be measured)\n  - Memory: no more than 10% increase in base memory usage\n\n####\n\n",

              "body": "#### Description of requested feature:\nMudlet is a Qt Widgets based application, which works great for Linux/macOS/Windows, but not so great for running natively on Android or iPhone, which are popular feature requests.\n\nAkin to how VLC is split into libVLC and various front-ends, split Mudlet out into libmudlet (providing all of core functionality) and a Qt Widget frontend that makes use of all of the core functionality.\n\n**Prior to taking this issue up**, open a new github issue here and in there, provide (1) plan for how the library/frontend split will work on an architectural level, and (2) a plan for the migration strategy, since once mega PR will not work for this.\n\n#### Reasons for adding feature:\n\n1. allowing Mudlet to eventually have a mobile-native version\n\n#### Expected result of feature\nlibmudlet may use Qt Core classes (QObject, QTimer, QThread, QSettings, etc.) but must not depend on Qt Widgets, Qt GUI, or any UI-related Qt modules.\n\n Mudlet's functionality pre and post-split should be 100% the same, nothing should be lost in the transition:\n -  All existing automated tests must pass, plus:\n  - All menu items and dialogs function identically\n  - All Lua API functions return identical results\n  - All protocol features work (GMCP, MXP, etc.)\n  - All file formats (profiles, packages) remain compatible\n\nPerformance of the network/text display stack as well as the trigger engine should be comparable as well (no more than 10% lost). Measured in:\n\n  - Text display: X lines/second in main console (can be measured using [stressinator](https://packages.mudlet.org/packages#pkg-Stressinator))\n  - Network: Y MB/s processing throughput (needs to be measured)\n  - Memory: no more than 10% increase in base memory usage\n\n####\n\n",

This is making it so I can't use the integration.\r\n\r\nWe also use Fastmail and have been seeing some oddities with the [cal.com](http://cal.com/) integration. Namely, that participants are receiving multiple calendar invites, which on it's own isn't that big of a deal. However, the Fastmail invites are always in UTC, not in the local time of the cal.com invite.\r\n\r\nThis is creating a lot of confusion with participants, they keep missing our meetings, not realizing one invite is UTC and one in local time. I spoke with the Fastmail team and they relayed the following notes about cal's specific integration.\r\n\r\n1. There is a property (SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT) a CalDAV client can add to the event that would prevent CalDAV servers from sending invitations. It appears cal.com is not setting this property even though they are sending an invitation.\r\n2. The invitation being sent by [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is using a different UID. Basically every event has a UID that uniquely identifies the event. Since [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is sending the invitation of the event with a different UID, if you end up adding this event to your calendar [cal.com](http://cal.com/), it will create a duplicate event in your calendar as well. They need to fix it so that all emails associated with a single event use the same original UID.\r\n3. The event added from [cal.com](http://cal.com/) doesn't have a timezone associated with it. Though it mentions the invitees timezone as \"America/Chicago\" in the notes, the event itself doesn't include a timezone and only specifies the time in UTC. Since the event time is specified in UTC, Fastmail's invitation email will also be sent in UTC.\r\n4. There seems to be no way to stop Cal.com from creating the calendar events at all, and thus no real workaround.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Connect to Fastmail using CalDav integration\r\n2. Create a test booking\r\n3. See issues above.\r\n\r\nAny other relevant information. For example, why do you consider this a bug and what did you expect to happen instead?\r\n1. SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT should be set, so Fastmail knows not to send an invitation. **This is the main one.**\r\n2. UID should be unique per event.\r\n3. Event time should have a timezone associated with it.\r\n4. An option could be added to make calendar event creation optional (nice-to-have, not essential).\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\n\r\nNone other than Fastmail/CalDAV.",
