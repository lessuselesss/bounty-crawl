Contributors must share vulnerable setup information or a testable instance by emailing templates@projectdiscovery.io. Providing a testable instance significantly reduces validation time and increases the chance of quicker rewards. Templates that are incomplete, invalid, or non-verifiable will not be accepted. Avoid submitting code templates for CVEs that can be detected using HTTP, TCP, or JavaScript only these are blocked by default and will not produce results. Exceptions may apply for certain cases. Do not submit AI-simulated vulnerable environments. To qualify for the bounty, the team must be able to fully validate the POC. If you have hosted a vulnerable environment for validation, send the details (IP or Docker setup) along with the PR number to templates[at]projectdiscovery.io\n\n---\n\n### References:\n- https://veeam.com\n- https://www.veeam.com/kb4288\n- https://securelist.com/cuba-ransomware/110533/\n- https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/avoslocker-ransomware-update\n- https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2025/05/08/inside-lockbit-defense-lessons-from-the-leaked-lockbit-negotiations\n\nYou can check the FAQ for the Nuclei Templates Community Rewards Program [here](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/discussions/9965)",

                  "body": "Hey, I've recently proposed something on Discord, and since feedback has been rather positive, I'm making a ticket to track the idea.\n\nI've been working with Queues recently, and I've been having some issues around `shutdown` that I would like to address.\n\nSpecifically, I find it a common pattern that I send some kind of request object through a queue because I want another fiber to perform some action on my behalf. Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",

              "body": "Hey, I've recently proposed something on Discord, and since feedback has been rather positive, I'm making a ticket to track the idea.\n\nI've been working with Queues recently, and I've been having some issues around `shutdown` that I would like to address.\n\nSpecifically, I find it a common pattern that I send some kind of request object through a queue because I want another fiber to perform some action on my behalf. Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",

Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",

We have many apps (we call them Pieces), that are available within the builder and as MCPs. These apps are build with our TypeScript framework and are easy to build. Once they're merged to our repo, they will available as pieces in our automation builder and as MCPs to be used with AI agents and MCP clients.\n\nWe welcome contributions and in fact, we get excited over them.
