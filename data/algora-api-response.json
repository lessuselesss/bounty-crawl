For example during my [boat project](https://discuss.px4.io/t/rc-speed-boat-with-px4-episode-1-using-px4-to-control-the-boat/28429#things-that-are-still-ambiguous-to-me-22) build, I wasn't sure if I needed to set the priority of magnetometer manually or not.\r\n\r\nThis is also quite related to the calibration pain addressed in the issue #19459. What can we do to improve user experience for setting up the sensors? If so, which part should be addressed and how?\r\n\r\nWhat could be great (in my opinion) could be something like this in QGC (it won't be a literal text output like this, but just for giving some idea):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # First mag sensor\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # One for the second mag\r\n<baro-type> |              | <baro-priority> | <baro-protocol>\r\n<gyro-type> | <gyro-orientation> | <gyro-priority> | <gyro-protocol>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I am also not sure what others expectation / needs are, so any feedback would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n## Describe your preferred solution\r\n* @davids5 pointed out that transferring device tree information over to QGC could be a solution. Could you elaborate on that?\r\n* @dagar pointed out that having a unified view in general would be good. Could you let me know if a view I suggested above is similar to what you have imagined?\r\n",

              "body": "## Describe problem solved by the proposed feature\r\nCurrently it is hard to figure out which sensors are connected where, with which configuration and which priority (e.g. `CAL_MAG0_PRIO`) in a single view. For example during my [boat project](https://discuss.px4.io/t/rc-speed-boat-with-px4-episode-1-using-px4-to-control-the-boat/28429#things-that-are-still-ambiguous-to-me-22) build, I wasn't sure if I needed to set the priority of magnetometer manually or not.\r\n\r\nThis is also quite related to the calibration pain addressed in the issue #19459. What can we do to improve user experience for setting up the sensors? If so, which part should be addressed and how?\r\n\r\nWhat could be great (in my opinion) could be something like this in QGC (it won't be a literal text output like this, but just for giving some idea):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # First mag sensor\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # One for the second mag\r\n<baro-type> |              | <baro-priority> | <baro-protocol>\r\n<gyro-type> | <gyro-orientation> | <gyro-priority> | <gyro-protocol>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I am also not sure what others expectation / needs are, so any feedback would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n## Describe your preferred solution\r\n* @davids5 pointed out that transferring device tree information over to QGC could be a solution. Could you elaborate on that?\r\n* @dagar pointed out that having a unified view in general would be good. Could you let me know if a view I suggested above is similar to what you have imagined?\r\n",

Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",

I have 11 collections, all of which are empty except for one named rrdb_matter_2. I haven't experimented with sharding or clusters yet, I am simply trying to test snapshots at scale. When I attempt to make a POST request to create a new snapshot (/collections/rrdb_matter_2/snapshots), I am eventually met with the following error:\r\n```\r\n[2023-09-07T20:37:53.799Z WARN  qdrant::actix::helpers] error processing request: Error while copy WAL \"./storage/snapshots_temp/rrdb_matter_2-1016472092926465-2023-09-07-20-37-31.tmp/0\" No such file or directory (os error 2)\r\n[2023-09-07T20:37:53.799Z INFO  actix_web::middleware::logger] 172.17.0.1 \"POST /collections/rrdb_matter_2/snapshots HTTP/1.1\" 500 195 \"-\" \"Apache-HttpClient/4.5.13 (Java/17.0.2)\" 21.905568\r\n```\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Pull latest docker image (v1.5.0)\r\n2. Run container using `docker run -p 6333:6333 -v $PWD/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z qdrant/qdrant:latest`\r\n3. After creating a new collection, load ~75,000 points with all 3 vector distances (euclidean, dot, cosine) referencing the same set of embeddings to the collection.\r\n4. Attempt to create a snapshot using the /collections/collection_name/snapshot POST request\r\n\r\nThe collection's stats are as follows:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\"status\":\"green\",\"optimizer_status\":\"ok\",\"vectors_count\":227400,\"indexed_vectors_count\":162600,\"points_count\":75800,\"segments_count\":4,\"config\":{\"params\":{\"vectors\":{\"cosine\":{\"size\":384,\"distance\":\"Cosine\"},\"dot\":{\"size\":384,\"distance\":\"Dot\"},\"euclidean\":{\"size\":384,\"distance\":\"Euclid\"}},\"shard_number\":1,\"replication_factor\":1,\"write_consistency_factor\":1,\"on_disk_payload\":true},\"hnsw_config\":{\"m\":16,\"ef_construct\":100,\"full_scan_threshold\":10000,\"max_indexing_threads\":0,\"on_disk\":false},\"optimizer_config\":{\"deleted_threshold\":0.2,\"vacuum_min_vector_number\":1000,\"default_segment_number\":0,\"max_segment_size\":null,\"memmap_threshold\":null,\"indexing_threshold\":20000,\"flush_interval_sec\":5,\"max_optimization_threads\":1},\"wal_config\":{\"wal_capacity_mb\":32,\"wal_segments_ahead\":0},\"quantization_config\":null},\"payload_schema\":{}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nSnapshot should be created, stored, and accessible via the REST API\r\n\r\n## Context (Environment)\r\nAttempted on Windows 10 Pro v10.0.19045\r\nRunning locally in order to establish a docker protocol to append to our existing docker stack. Haven't run into these issues when running on a cloud instance.\r\n",
