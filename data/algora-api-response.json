This means automated backups are not available for databases in these deployments.\n\nHowever, when using \"Empty Docker Compose\" or one-click services (like Supabase), database detection works correctly and backups are available.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\n| Deployment Method | Model | Creates ServiceDatabase | Backups Available |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Empty Docker Compose | `Service` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |\n| GitHub App (dockercompose buildpack) | `Application` | ❌ No | ❌ No |\n| One-click Services (e.g., Supabase) | `Service` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nDatabase services in Docker Compose files deployed via GitHub App should be detected and have backup functionality available, similar to Empty Docker Compose deployments.\n\n### Technical Details\n\nThe issue is in `bootstrap/helpers/shared.php` in the `parseDockerComposeFile()` function:\n\n**Service model path (lines 1263-2025):**\n- Calls `isDatabaseImage()` to detect databases\n- Creates `ServiceDatabase` records for detected databases\n- These databases can have scheduled backups\n\n**Application model path (lines 2026-2767):**\n- Does NOT call `isDatabaseImage()`\n- Does NOT create `ServiceDatabase` records\n- All services are treated as application containers\n- No backup support\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nAdd database detection logic to the Application model parsing path:\n\n1. In `parseDockerComposeFile()` for the Application model (around line 2066), add:\n   ```php\n   $isDatabase = isDatabaseImage($image, $service);\n   data_set($service, 'is_database', $isDatabase);\n   ```\n\n2. Create `ServiceDatabase` records for detected database services, similar to how it's done in the Service model path.\n\n3. Alternatively, consider refactoring to share the database detection logic between both paths.\n\n### Use Case\n\nUsers deploying full-stack applications via GitHub (e.g., Next.js app + PostgreSQL + pgbouncer in a single compose file) expect database backups to work the same way as standalone database deployments or one-click services.\n\n### Related Code\n\n- `bootstrap/helpers/shared.php` - `parseDockerComposeFile()` function\n- `bootstrap/helpers/docker.php` - `isDatabaseImage()` function\n- `app/Models/ServiceDatabase.php` - Database model with backup support\n- `app/Models/ScheduledDatabaseBackup.php` - Backup scheduling\n\n### Environment\n\n- Coolify version: latest\n- Deployment method: GitHub App with dockercompose buildpack\n",

In `parseDockerComposeFile()` for the Application model (around line 2066), add:\n   ```php\n   $isDatabase = isDatabaseImage($image, $service);\n   data_set($service, 'is_database', $isDatabase);\n   ```\n\n2. Create `ServiceDatabase` records for detected database services, similar to how it's done in the Service model path.\n\n3. Alternatively, consider refactoring to share the database detection logic between both paths.\n\n### Use Case\n\nUsers deploying full-stack applications via GitHub (e.g., Next.js app + PostgreSQL + pgbouncer in a single compose file) expect database backups to work the same way as standalone database deployments or one-click services.\n\n### Related Code\n\n- `bootstrap/helpers/shared.php` - `parseDockerComposeFile()` function\n- `bootstrap/helpers/docker.php` - `isDatabaseImage()` function\n- `app/Models/ServiceDatabase.php` - Database model with backup support\n- `app/Models/ScheduledDatabaseBackup.php` - Backup scheduling\n\n### Environment\n\n- Coolify version: latest\n- Deployment method: GitHub App with dockercompose buildpack\n",

It's time...\n- **[$XXX]** CoolifyAI -- add API key, get AI assistant w/ knowledge-base similar to the Supabase assistant, ideally with GitHub issue lookup and basic research capability  \n- **[$XXX - $X,XXX]** More proper, fleshed out \"Services\" template system WITH ability to add remote repositories outside of the official Coolify templates; setup scripting w/ select-able options, easily modify docker template or automations/commands with checkboxes, dropdowns and input fields and the works. Ideally, a system in which \"addons\" in these same repositories as the whole \"Services\" themselves can be added on to each individual service; I.e. for Cloudflared, my request above. Or for Supabase, an easy tool to help you visualize the parts missing from Selfhosted that are in Supabase SaaS/Cloud and perhaps an API to interface with it. **This would make Coolify the single self-hosted PaaS with scripting for templates, but also an extension system allowing new functionality.**\n\nIf you are interested in discussing, claiming or collaborating on one of these bounties, see the little repo I made to track this here:\nhttps://github.com/rootacc3ss/coolify-bounties/tree/main",
