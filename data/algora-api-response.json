Your task is to extend the current piece by adding additional actions and triggers as outlined in the documentation and reference materials.\nPlease avoid duplicating existing functionality. Review the current implementation before making changes, and ensure that all new features follow existing coding patterns and standards.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 Triggers  \n\n| **Trigger** | **Use Case** |\n|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------|\n| **New Starred Email** | Fires when an email is starred (within 2 days).|\n| **New Conversation** | Fires when a new conversation (thread) begins.|\n|**New Attachment**|Fires when an email with an attachment arrives (with optional filters).|\n|**New Label**|Triggers when a new label is created.|\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Write Actions  \n\n| **Action Item**               | **Use Case** |\n|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------|\n| **Reply to Email** | Reply within an existing thread, maintaining context. |\n| **Create Draft Reply** | Generate a reply draft within an existing thread.|\n| **Add Label to Email** | Attach a label to an individual email.|\n|**Remove Label from Email**|Remove a specific label from an email.Remove a specific label from an email.|\n|**Create Label**|Create a new user label in Gmail.|\n|**Archive Email**|Archive (move to “All Mail”) rather than deleting.|\n|**Delete Email**|Permanently move an email to Trash.|\n|**Remove Label from Thread**|Strip a label from all emails in a thread.|\n---\n\n## 🔍 Search Actions  \n\n| **Action Item**               | **Use Case**                                                                                                                                     |\n|:------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Find Email** | Locate a specific email using search keywords like subject, sender, or content.|\n\n---\n\n\n## 📚 API Reference  \n- [Official Gmail API Documentation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/guides)\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Test Account Access  \nYou can test Gmail APIs using a Google account with enabled Gmail API in a [Google Cloud Project Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n\n---\n\n## 🧑‍💻 New to Activepieces?\n\nActivepieces is the leading open source AI automation platform. We have many apps (we call them Pieces), that are available within the builder and as MCPs. These apps are built with our TypeScript framework and are easy to develop. Once merged into our repository, they become available as pieces in our automation builder and as MCPs usable by AI agents and MCP clients.\n\nStart building here: [Piece Development Docs](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/developers/building-pieces/overview)\n",

Instead, I want to invite them to a specific project on Coolify and for them to only have access to that project.\n\nAdditionally, I want to optionally allow the project-specific member to deploy their own apps on the servers on the account. This will just create a new project in the Team with them as a project-specific member.\n\nI should be able to manage all project-specific members from the main team page in addition to on each project’s page.\n\nAny APIs that exist for managing team members should also work for project-specific members.\n\nThe purpose of this bounty is to create a secure way to give people limited access to projects on Coolify. They must not be able to break out of their permissions. For example, if I can SSH into a server as a project member using one of the keys - that would allow me to break out of my permissions.\n\nAcceptance criteria: Once your PR is merged and deployed on Coolify Cloud, I will test the features and award the bounty.

Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",

Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",
