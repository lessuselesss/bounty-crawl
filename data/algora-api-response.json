In `parseDockerComposeFile()` for the Application model (around line 2066), add:\n   ```php\n   $isDatabase = isDatabaseImage($image, $service);\n   data_set($service, 'is_database', $isDatabase);\n   ```\n\n2.

Contributors are required to provide debug data(`-debug`) along with the template to help the triage team with validation or can also share a vulnerable environment like docker file. \n\n> Rewards will only be given once the template is fully validated by the team. Templates that are incomplete or invalid will not be accepted. Avoid adding code templates for CVEs that can be achieved using HTTP, TCP, or JavaScript. Such templates are blocked by default and won’t produce results, so we prioritize creating templates with other protocols unless exceptions are made.\n\nYou can check the FAQ for the Nuclei Templates Community Rewards Program [here](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/main/Community-Rewards-FAQ.md).\n",
