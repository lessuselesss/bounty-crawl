This leads to a frame drop every time the canvas is snapshotted.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nGo to the Codsandbox full-screen here https://jqgtld.csb.app/ \r\n\r\nLook at the \"Snapshot\" stat in the top right corner (or in the console). On my computer it is ~20ms on Safari 16.5. On Chrome, it is between 0 and 0.3ms.\r\n\r\nThe window size is 1057 x 734 (retina display, so double the dimensions for the canvas)\r\n\r\nHere's the codesandbox with the editor: https://codesandbox.io/s/dazzling-roentgen-jqgtld?file=/src/App.js\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nOverhead for snapshotting to be near 0\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n## Safari\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 23 03 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/1bc6d193-ea1f-4fda-ae03-7ea9c9cf9143)\r\n\r\n## Chrome\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 23 55 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/7a3767f7-94a0-467b-9c23-bac305507d66)\r\n\r\n## iOS\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 27 57 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/664fc6c4-27b8-43ce-be71-b35b7553716f)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 13.4\r\n    CPU: (8) arm64 Apple M1\r\n    Memory: 51.78 MB / 8.00 GB\r\nBrowsers:\r\n    Chrome: 117.0.5938.92\r\n    Safari: 16.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nProvided this also affects Safari 17 (I don't know if it does), this affects _every_ Safari-based browser (including everything on iOS). This performance drop means we had to disable canvas recording for Safari on our app which really limits its usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe larger the canvas, the longer the snapshot time, from what I can tell. Changing `canvasMaxSnapshotDimension` does not appear to make a difference. Safari doesn't even respect the options parameter for `createBitmapImage`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/createImageBitmap\r\n\r\nI'm reasonably confident this comes from the call to `createBitmapImage` here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/highlight/highlight/blob/ed2ea183d0d11781736e2001b01e24e55c33e8cb/frontend/src/__generated/rr/rr.js#L4266-L4269\r\n\r\nIt's supposed to be asynchronous but it looks like it is blocking in Safari. I wonder if there are other ways to get the image data out of a canvas? I understand there are efforts to use WebRTC for canvas recording? I imagine this could help.\r\n",

              "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nSnapshotting a canvas element in Safari 16.x takes a long time (>20ms). This leads to a frame drop every time the canvas is snapshotted.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nGo to the Codsandbox full-screen here https://jqgtld.csb.app/ \r\n\r\nLook at the \"Snapshot\" stat in the top right corner (or in the console). On my computer it is ~20ms on Safari 16.5. On Chrome, it is between 0 and 0.3ms.\r\n\r\nThe window size is 1057 x 734 (retina display, so double the dimensions for the canvas)\r\n\r\nHere's the codesandbox with the editor: https://codesandbox.io/s/dazzling-roentgen-jqgtld?file=/src/App.js\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nOverhead for snapshotting to be near 0\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n## Safari\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 23 03 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/1bc6d193-ea1f-4fda-ae03-7ea9c9cf9143)\r\n\r\n## Chrome\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 23 55 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/7a3767f7-94a0-467b-9c23-bac305507d66)\r\n\r\n## iOS\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 27 57 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/664fc6c4-27b8-43ce-be71-b35b7553716f)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 13.4\r\n    CPU: (8) arm64 Apple M1\r\n    Memory: 51.78 MB / 8.00 GB\r\nBrowsers:\r\n    Chrome: 117.0.5938.92\r\n    Safari: 16.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nProvided this also affects Safari 17 (I don't know if it does), this affects _every_ Safari-based browser (including everything on iOS). This performance drop means we had to disable canvas recording for Safari on our app which really limits its usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe larger the canvas, the longer the snapshot time, from what I can tell. Changing `canvasMaxSnapshotDimension` does not appear to make a difference. Safari doesn't even respect the options parameter for `createBitmapImage`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/createImageBitmap\r\n\r\nI'm reasonably confident this comes from the call to `createBitmapImage` here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/highlight/highlight/blob/ed2ea183d0d11781736e2001b01e24e55c33e8cb/frontend/src/__generated/rr/rr.js#L4266-L4269\r\n\r\nIt's supposed to be asynchronous but it looks like it is blocking in Safari. I wonder if there are other ways to get the image data out of a canvas? I understand there are efforts to use WebRTC for canvas recording? I imagine this could help.\r\n",
