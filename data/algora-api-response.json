For example during my [boat project](https://discuss.px4.io/t/rc-speed-boat-with-px4-episode-1-using-px4-to-control-the-boat/28429#things-that-are-still-ambiguous-to-me-22) build, I wasn't sure if I needed to set the priority of magnetometer manually or not.\r\n\r\nThis is also quite related to the calibration pain addressed in the issue #19459. What can we do to improve user experience for setting up the sensors? If so, which part should be addressed and how?\r\n\r\nWhat could be great (in my opinion) could be something like this in QGC (it won't be a literal text output like this, but just for giving some idea):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # First mag sensor\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # One for the second mag\r\n<baro-type> |              | <baro-priority> | <baro-protocol>\r\n<gyro-type> | <gyro-orientation> | <gyro-priority> | <gyro-protocol>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I am also not sure what others expectation / needs are, so any feedback would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n## Describe your preferred solution\r\n* @davids5 pointed out that transferring device tree information over to QGC could be a solution. Could you elaborate on that?\r\n* @dagar pointed out that having a unified view in general would be good. Could you let me know if a view I suggested above is similar to what you have imagined?\r\n",

              "body": "## Describe problem solved by the proposed feature\r\nCurrently it is hard to figure out which sensors are connected where, with which configuration and which priority (e.g. `CAL_MAG0_PRIO`) in a single view. For example during my [boat project](https://discuss.px4.io/t/rc-speed-boat-with-px4-episode-1-using-px4-to-control-the-boat/28429#things-that-are-still-ambiguous-to-me-22) build, I wasn't sure if I needed to set the priority of magnetometer manually or not.\r\n\r\nThis is also quite related to the calibration pain addressed in the issue #19459. What can we do to improve user experience for setting up the sensors? If so, which part should be addressed and how?\r\n\r\nWhat could be great (in my opinion) could be something like this in QGC (it won't be a literal text output like this, but just for giving some idea):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # First mag sensor\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # One for the second mag\r\n<baro-type> |              | <baro-priority> | <baro-protocol>\r\n<gyro-type> | <gyro-orientation> | <gyro-priority> | <gyro-protocol>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I am also not sure what others expectation / needs are, so any feedback would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n## Describe your preferred solution\r\n* @davids5 pointed out that transferring device tree information over to QGC could be a solution. Could you elaborate on that?\r\n* @dagar pointed out that having a unified view in general would be good. Could you let me know if a view I suggested above is similar to what you have imagined?\r\n",

                  "body": "# Algebraic Patch/Diff System for ZIO Schema 2\n\n## Overview\n\nImplement a pure, algebraic patch/diff system for ZIO Schema 2 that represents structural changes as first-class, serializable data. The system provides a typed API (`Patch[A]`) built on an untyped core (`DynamicPatch`) that operates on `DynamicValue`.\n\nBelow is a rough outline or sketch of the design of patching & diffing, subject to revision by the implementor based on technical feasibility considerations.\n\n## Core Architecture\n\n### Type Hierarchy\n\n```scala\n// Typed patch (user-facing API)\ncase class Patch[A](dynamicPatch: DynamicPatch, schema: Schema[A]) {\n  /** Apply patch with specified mode */\n  def apply(value: A, mode: PatchMode = PatchMode.Strict): Either[SchemaError, A]\n  \n  /** Compose patches sequentially (monoid operation) */\n  def ++(that: Patch[A]): Patch[A]\n}\n\n// Untyped patch (operates on DynamicValue)\ncase class DynamicPatch(ops: Vector[DynamicPatchOp]) {\n  /** Apply to dynamic value */\n  def apply(value: DynamicValue, mode: PatchMode): Either[SchemaError, DynamicValue]\n  \n  /** Compose patches */\n  def ++(that: DynamicPatch): DynamicPatch\n}\n```\n\n### Operations\n\n```scala\ncase class DynamicPatchOp(optic: DynamicOptic, operation: Operation)\n\nsealed trait Operation\nobject Operation {\n  case class Set(value: DynamicValue) extends Operation\n  case class PrimitiveDelta(op: PrimitiveOp) extends Operation\n  case class SequenceEdit(ops: Vector[SeqOp]) extends Operation\n  case class MapEdit(ops: Vector[MapOp]) extends Operation\n}\n```\n\n## Typed API\n\nAll typed operations live in `Patch` companion object:\n\n```scala\nobject Patch {\n  /** Empty patch (monoid identity) */\n  def empty[A](implicit schema: Schema[A]): Patch[A]\n  \n  /** Set a field/element to a value (clobber semantics) */\n  def set[S, A](optic: Optic[S, A], value: A)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  \n  /** Increment numeric field */\n  def increment[S](optic: Optic[S, Int], delta: Int)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def incrementLong[S](optic: Optic[S, Long], delta: Long)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def incrementDouble[S](optic: Optic[S, Double], delta: Double)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  \n  /** Edit string field */\n  def editString[S](optic: Optic[S, String], edits: Vector[StringOp])(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  \n  /** Sequence operations */\n  def append[S, A](optic: Optic[S, Vector[A]], elements: Vector[A])(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def insertAt[S, A](optic: Optic[S, Vector[A]], index: Int, elements: Vector[A])(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def deleteAt[S, A](optic: Optic[S, Vector[A]], index: Int, count: Int)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  \n  /** Map operations */\n  def addKey[S, K, V](optic: Optic[S, Map[K, V]], key: K, value: V)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def removeKey[S, K, V](optic: Optic[S, Map[K, V]], key: K)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def modifyKey[S, K, V](optic: Optic[S, Map[K, V]], key: K, valuePatch: Patch[V])(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n}\n```\n\n## Primitive Operations\n\n```scala\nsealed trait PrimitiveOp\nobject PrimitiveOp {\n  // Numeric deltas\n  case class IntDelta(delta: Int) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class LongDelta(delta: Long) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class DoubleDelta(delta: Double) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class FloatDelta(delta: Float) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class ShortDelta(delta: Short) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class ByteDelta(delta: Byte) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class BigIntDelta(delta: BigInt) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class BigDecimalDelta(delta: BigDecimal) extends PrimitiveOp\n  \n  // String edits (LCS-based)\n  case class StringEdit(ops: Vector[StringOp]) extends PrimitiveOp\n  \n  // Temporal deltas\n  case class InstantDelta(duration: java.time.Duration) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class DurationDelta(duration: java.time.Duration) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class LocalDateDelta(period: java.time.Period) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class LocalDateTimeDelta(period: java.time.Period, duration: java.time.Duration) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class PeriodDelta(period: java.time.Period) extends PrimitiveOp\n  // ... other temporal types\n}\n\nsealed trait StringOp\nobject StringOp {\n  case class Insert(index: Int, text: String) extends StringOp\n  case class Delete(index: Int, length: Int) extends StringOp\n}\n```\n\n## Collection Operations\n\n```scala\nsealed trait SeqOp\nobject SeqOp {\n  /** Insert at index (fails if index occupied in Strict mode) */\n  case class Insert(index: Int, values: Vector[DynamicValue]) extends SeqOp\n  \n  /** Append to end (always succeeds) */\n  case class Append(values: Vector[DynamicValue]) extends SeqOp\n  \n  /** Delete count elements starting at index */\n  case class Delete(index: Int, count: Int) extends SeqOp\n  \n  /** Modify element at index with nested operation */\n  case class Modify(index: Int, op: Operation) extends SeqOp\n}\n\nsealed trait MapOp\nobject MapOp {\n  /** Add key-value (fails if key exists in Strict mode) */\n  case class Add(key: DynamicValue, value: DynamicValue) extends MapOp\n  \n  /** Remove key (fails if key missing in Strict mode) */\n  case class Remove(key: DynamicValue) extends MapOp\n  \n  /** Modify value at key with nested operation */\n  case class Modify(key: DynamicValue, op: Operation) extends MapOp\n}\n```\n\n## Patch Application Modes\n\n```scala\nsealed trait PatchMode\nobject PatchMode {\n  /** Fail on precondition violations (e.g. modifying non-existent key) */\n  case object Strict extends PatchMode\n  \n  /** Skip operations that fail preconditions */\n  case object Lenient extends PatchMode\n  \n  /** Replace/overwrite on conflicts */\n  case object Clobber extends PatchMode\n}\n```\n\n## Schema Integration\n\n```scala\ntrait Schema[A] {\n  /** \n   * Compute smart patch from oldValue to newValue.\n   * Uses heuristics to choose between delta/edit vs set operations.\n   */\n  def diff(oldValue: A, newValue: A): Patch[A]\n  \n  /** Convenience method - apply patch with Strict mode */\n  def patch(value: A, patch: Patch[A]): Either[SchemaError, A] =\n    patch.apply(value, PatchMode.Strict)\n}\n```\n\n## Diffing Strategy\n\nThe `Schema#diff` implementation uses smart heuristics:\n\n1. **New elements/keys**: Use `Operation.Set` \n   - Sequence insertions at new indices\n   - Map additions for new keys\n   - Sum type switches to different cases\n\n2. **String modifications**: Use `StringEdit` if edit sequence is shorter than new string, otherwise use `Set`\n\n3. **Numeric modifications**: Use delta operations (`IntDelta`, etc.)\n\n4. **Structural modifications**: Recursively diff nested structures, using field-level patches for records\n\n5. **Temporal modifications**: Use temporal delta operations for date/time types\n\n## Laws\n\n### Roundtrip Law\nFor all values, the following must hold:\n```scala\n∀ (schema: Schema[A], old: A, new: A).\n  schema.diff(old, new).apply(old) == Right(new)\n```\n\n### Monoid Laws\n```scala\n// Identity (empty patch)\n∀ (p: Patch[A]). \n  p ++ Patch.empty == p\n  Patch.empty ++ p == p\n\n// Associativity\n∀ (p1: Patch[A], p2: Patch[A], p3: Patch[A]).\n  (p1 ++ p2) ++ p3 == p1 ++ (p2 ++ p3)\n```\n\n### Serializability\nAll patch types are pure data (DynamicValue, DynamicOptic, primitives) and must be serializable:\n```scala\n∀ (p: Patch[A]). \n  jsonCodec.decode(jsonCodec.encode(p)) == Right(p)\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- `Operation.Set` uses `DynamicValue` to represent whole values for materialization cases\n- `Patch[A]` converts typed values to `DynamicValue` via `Schema[A]` before applying `DynamicPatch` constructor\n- String edits use LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) algorithm\n-

              "body": "# Algebraic Patch/Diff System for ZIO Schema 2\n\n## Overview\n\nImplement a pure, algebraic patch/diff system for ZIO Schema 2 that represents structural changes as first-class, serializable data. The system provides a typed API (`Patch[A]`) built on an untyped core (`DynamicPatch`) that operates on `DynamicValue`.\n\nBelow is a rough outline or sketch of the design of patching & diffing, subject to revision by the implementor based on technical feasibility considerations.\n\n## Core Architecture\n\n### Type Hierarchy\n\n```scala\n// Typed patch (user-facing API)\ncase class Patch[A](dynamicPatch: DynamicPatch, schema: Schema[A]) {\n  /** Apply patch with specified mode */\n  def apply(value: A, mode: PatchMode = PatchMode.Strict): Either[SchemaError, A]\n  \n  /** Compose patches sequentially (monoid operation) */\n  def ++(that: Patch[A]): Patch[A]\n}\n\n// Untyped patch (operates on DynamicValue)\ncase class DynamicPatch(ops: Vector[DynamicPatchOp]) {\n  /** Apply to dynamic value */\n  def apply(value: DynamicValue, mode: PatchMode): Either[SchemaError, DynamicValue]\n  \n  /** Compose patches */\n  def ++(that: DynamicPatch): DynamicPatch\n}\n```\n\n### Operations\n\n```scala\ncase class DynamicPatchOp(optic: DynamicOptic, operation: Operation)\n\nsealed trait Operation\nobject Operation {\n  case class Set(value: DynamicValue) extends Operation\n  case class PrimitiveDelta(op: PrimitiveOp) extends Operation\n  case class SequenceEdit(ops: Vector[SeqOp]) extends Operation\n  case class MapEdit(ops: Vector[MapOp]) extends Operation\n}\n```\n\n## Typed API\n\nAll typed operations live in `Patch` companion object:\n\n```scala\nobject Patch {\n  /** Empty patch (monoid identity) */\n  def empty[A](implicit schema: Schema[A]): Patch[A]\n  \n  /** Set a field/element to a value (clobber semantics) */\n  def set[S, A](optic: Optic[S, A], value: A)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  \n  /** Increment numeric field */\n  def increment[S](optic: Optic[S, Int], delta: Int)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def incrementLong[S](optic: Optic[S, Long], delta: Long)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def incrementDouble[S](optic: Optic[S, Double], delta: Double)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  \n  /** Edit string field */\n  def editString[S](optic: Optic[S, String], edits: Vector[StringOp])(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  \n  /** Sequence operations */\n  def append[S, A](optic: Optic[S, Vector[A]], elements: Vector[A])(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def insertAt[S, A](optic: Optic[S, Vector[A]], index: Int, elements: Vector[A])(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def deleteAt[S, A](optic: Optic[S, Vector[A]], index: Int, count: Int)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  \n  /** Map operations */\n  def addKey[S, K, V](optic: Optic[S, Map[K, V]], key: K, value: V)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def removeKey[S, K, V](optic: Optic[S, Map[K, V]], key: K)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def modifyKey[S, K, V](optic: Optic[S, Map[K, V]], key: K, valuePatch: Patch[V])(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n}\n```\n\n## Primitive Operations\n\n```scala\nsealed trait PrimitiveOp\nobject PrimitiveOp {\n  // Numeric deltas\n  case class IntDelta(delta: Int) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class LongDelta(delta: Long) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class DoubleDelta(delta: Double) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class FloatDelta(delta: Float) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class ShortDelta(delta: Short) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class ByteDelta(delta: Byte) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class BigIntDelta(delta: BigInt) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class BigDecimalDelta(delta: BigDecimal) extends PrimitiveOp\n  \n  // String edits (LCS-based)\n  case class StringEdit(ops: Vector[StringOp]) extends PrimitiveOp\n  \n  // Temporal deltas\n  case class InstantDelta(duration: java.time.Duration) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class DurationDelta(duration: java.time.Duration) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class LocalDateDelta(period: java.time.Period) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class LocalDateTimeDelta(period: java.time.Period, duration: java.time.Duration) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class PeriodDelta(period: java.time.Period) extends PrimitiveOp\n  // ... other temporal types\n}\n\nsealed trait StringOp\nobject StringOp {\n  case class Insert(index: Int, text: String) extends StringOp\n  case class Delete(index: Int, length: Int) extends StringOp\n}\n```\n\n## Collection Operations\n\n```scala\nsealed trait SeqOp\nobject SeqOp {\n  /** Insert at index (fails if index occupied in Strict mode) */\n  case class Insert(index: Int, values: Vector[DynamicValue]) extends SeqOp\n  \n  /** Append to end (always succeeds) */\n  case class Append(values: Vector[DynamicValue]) extends SeqOp\n  \n  /** Delete count elements starting at index */\n  case class Delete(index: Int, count: Int) extends SeqOp\n  \n  /** Modify element at index with nested operation */\n  case class Modify(index: Int, op: Operation) extends SeqOp\n}\n\nsealed trait MapOp\nobject MapOp {\n  /** Add key-value (fails if key exists in Strict mode) */\n  case class Add(key: DynamicValue, value: DynamicValue) extends MapOp\n  \n  /** Remove key (fails if key missing in Strict mode) */\n  case class Remove(key: DynamicValue) extends MapOp\n  \n  /** Modify value at key with nested operation */\n  case class Modify(key: DynamicValue, op: Operation) extends MapOp\n}\n```\n\n## Patch Application Modes\n\n```scala\nsealed trait PatchMode\nobject PatchMode {\n  /** Fail on precondition violations (e.g. modifying non-existent key) */\n  case object Strict extends PatchMode\n  \n  /** Skip operations that fail preconditions */\n  case object Lenient extends PatchMode\n  \n  /** Replace/overwrite on conflicts */\n  case object Clobber extends PatchMode\n}\n```\n\n## Schema Integration\n\n```scala\ntrait Schema[A] {\n  /** \n   * Compute smart patch from oldValue to newValue.\n   * Uses heuristics to choose between delta/edit vs set operations.\n   */\n  def diff(oldValue: A, newValue: A): Patch[A]\n  \n  /** Convenience method - apply patch with Strict mode */\n  def patch(value: A, patch: Patch[A]): Either[SchemaError, A] =\n    patch.apply(value, PatchMode.Strict)\n}\n```\n\n## Diffing Strategy\n\nThe `Schema#diff` implementation uses smart heuristics:\n\n1. **New elements/keys**: Use `Operation.Set` \n   - Sequence insertions at new indices\n   - Map additions for new keys\n   - Sum type switches to different cases\n\n2. **String modifications**: Use `StringEdit` if edit sequence is shorter than new string, otherwise use `Set`\n\n3. **Numeric modifications**: Use delta operations (`IntDelta`, etc.)\n\n4. **Structural modifications**: Recursively diff nested structures, using field-level patches for records\n\n5. **Temporal modifications**: Use temporal delta operations for date/time types\n\n## Laws\n\n### Roundtrip Law\nFor all values, the following must hold:\n```scala\n∀ (schema: Schema[A], old: A, new: A).\n  schema.diff(old, new).apply(old) == Right(new)\n```\n\n### Monoid Laws\n```scala\n// Identity (empty patch)\n∀ (p: Patch[A]). \n  p ++ Patch.empty == p\n  Patch.empty ++ p == p\n\n// Associativity\n∀ (p1: Patch[A], p2: Patch[A], p3: Patch[A]).\n  (p1 ++ p2) ++ p3 == p1 ++ (p2 ++ p3)\n```\n\n### Serializability\nAll patch types are pure data (DynamicValue, DynamicOptic, primitives) and must be serializable:\n```scala\n∀ (p: Patch[A]). \n  jsonCodec.decode(jsonCodec.encode(p)) == Right(p)\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- `Operation.Set` uses `DynamicValue` to represent whole values for materialization cases\n- `Patch[A]` converts typed values to `DynamicValue` via `Schema[A]` before applying `DynamicPatch` constructor\n- String edits use LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) algorithm\n- Sequence edits also use LCS for computing minimal insert/delete sequences\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] `DynamicPatch` defined with all operation types, capable of transforming one DynamicValue to another in the most minimal possible way\n- [ ] `Patch[A]` wraps `DynamicPatch` with an additional `Schema[A]`\n- [ ] Typed API in `Patch` companion object for all common operations\n- [ ] `Schema#diff` implements smart diffing strategy\n- [ ] `PatchMode` controls patch application behavior\n- [ ] All fallible operations return `Either[SchemaError, A]` so error information is

serialized unless `Schema` is serialized, which in the general case requires a `TypeRegistry`)\n- [ ] String diffs use LCS algorithm\n- [ ] Sequence diffs use LCS algorithm\n- [ ] Comprehensive tests for all operation types, and for serialization of non-`Patch` types such as DynamicPatch and everything it contains\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```scala\n@schema \n@optics\ncase class Person(name: String,

These annotation macros will add new definitions in the companion object of the trait / class / enum to which they are applied.\n\nThe annotation macros are as follows:\n\n - `@optic`: Adds optics for all terms of the record / enum inside the companion object. Comes in an optional variant, called `@optics_`, which prefixes all optics with an underscore character (`_`) to avoid name collisions. The names of these optics are the same as the term names, except for sum term names, the first letter is lower-cased to avoid colliding with the object of the same name in the same scope.\n - `@schema`: Adds an `implicit` / `given` schema for the record / enum inside the companion object, with the name `<xyz>Schema`, e.g. `personSchema`.\n\n**Note 1**: In the ideal case, applying `@optics`

Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",
