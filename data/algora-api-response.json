              "body": "I am using zio 2.1.17. When I run the following code:\n\n```scala\ndef fakeNetworkCall(n: Int): ZIO[Any, Throwable, String] = {\n  for {\n    _ <- Console.printLine(s\"Starting request $n\")\n    _ <- ZIO.sleep(1.second)\n    _ <- Console.printLine(s\"Completed request $n\")\n  } yield s\"Response for $n\"\n}\n\nval program: ZIO[Any, Throwable, Unit] =\n  ZStream\n    .fromIterator(Iterator.from(1))\n    .mapZIO(fakeNetworkCall)\n    .buffer(1)\n    .runForeach { response =>\n      for {\n        _ <- Console.printLine(s\"Press Enter to process $response...\")\n        _ <- ZIO.sleep(100.minutes)\n        _ <- Console.printLine(s\"Processing response $response\")\n        _ <- ZIO.sleep(1.second)\n        _ <- Console.printLine(s\"Done processing $response\")\n      } yield ()\n    }\n```\nThe full code is [here](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/douglasthomsen/kvRuhoAGRjarj9djF53N0g/10).\n\nWhen i get to the `_ <- ZIO.sleep(100.minutes)` line I would expect the output to be like this:\n```\nStarting request 1\nCompleted request 1\nStarting request 2\nPress Enter to process Response for 1...\nCompleted request 2\n```\n\nbut I am getting the following:\n```\nStarting request 1\nCompleted request 1\nStarting request 2\nPress Enter to process Response for 1...\nCompleted request 2\nStarting request 3\nCompleted request 3\n```\n\nMy goal is to only buffer one call to `fakeNetworkCall` at time. Right now it looks like it is buffering two. I am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?",

Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",
