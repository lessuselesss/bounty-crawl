                  "body": "I have attached to this ticket a WIT file that describes a generic interface for text-to-speech operations. This interface can be implemented by various providers, either by emulating features not present in a given provider, utilizing the provider's native support for a feature, or indicating an error if a particular combination is not natively supported by a provider.\n\nThe intent of this WIT specification is to allow developers of WASM components (on wasmCloud, Spin, or Golem) to leverage text-to-speech capabilities to build voice-powered applications, accessibility services, and audio content generation systems in a portable and provider-agnostic fashion.\n\nThis ticket involves constructing implementations of this WIT interface for the following providers:\n\n- **ElevenLabs**: The leading AI voice synthesis platform with comprehensive voice cloning, real-time streaming, voice conversion, and sound effects generation capabilities.\n- **AWS Polly**: Amazon's enterprise text-to-speech service with extensive language support, custom lexicons, speech marks, and asynchronous synthesis for long-form content.\n- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech**: Google's neural voice synthesis service with WaveNet and Neural2 voices, device optimization profiles, and streaming synthesis capabilities.\n- **Deepgram Aura**: High-performance real-time TTS with session-based streaming, low-latency neural voices, and conversational AI optimization.\n\nThese implementations must be written in Rust and compilable to WASM Components (WASI 0.23 only, since Golem does not yet support WASI 0.3). The standard Rust toolchain for WASM component development can be employed (see cargo component and the Rust examples of components in this and other Golem repositories).\n\nAdditionally, these implementations should incorporate custom durability semantics using the Golem durability API and the Golem host API. This approach ensures that durability is managed at the level of individual TTS operations (voice synthesis, streaming session creation, voice cloning, batch processing), providing a higher-level and clearer operation log, which aids in debugging and monitoring. See golem:llm and golem:embed for more details and durable implementations in this same repository.\n\nThe final deliverables associated with this ticket are:\n\n- **ElevenLabs implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-elevenlabs.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **AWS Polly implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-polly.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Google Cloud TTS implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-google.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Deepgram Aura implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-deepgram.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n\n**Note**: If you have a strong recommendation to swap out one or two of these with other popular / common TTS providers (such as Azure Cognitive Services Speech, IBM Watson Text to Speech, or OpenAI TTS), then as long as you get permission beforehand, that's okay with me. However, we definitely need ElevenLabs and AWS Polly.\n\nThese components will require runtime configuration, notably API keys, endpoint URLs, authentication credentials, and provider-specific settings. For configuring this information, the components can use environment variables for now (in the future, they will use wasi-runtime-config, but Golem does not support this yet, whereas Golem has good support for environment variables).\n\nMoreover, the Rust components need to be tested within Golem to ensure compatibility with Golem 1.2.x.\n\nThis WIT has been designed by examining and comparing the APIs of ElevenLabs, AWS Polly, Google Cloud TTS, Azure Speech Services, OpenAI TTS, and Deepgram Aura. However, given there are no implementations, it is possible the provided WIT is not the optimal abstraction across all these providers. Therefore, deviations from the proposed design can be made. However, to be accepted, any deviation must be fully justified and deemed by Golem core contributors to be an improvement from the original specification.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\nEach provider implementation should handle the following key mapping considerations:\n\n- **Voice Management**: Map the unified voice resource to provider-specific voice identifiers, handle voice discovery and metadata appropriately for each provider's voice catalog structure\n- **Audio Format Conversion**: Implement native audio format support where available, or provide format conversion for unsupported output formats using audio processing libraries\n- **Streaming Implementation**: Utilize native streaming APIs where supported (ElevenLabs, Deepgram), or implement chunk-based synthesis for providers without native streaming support\n- **Authentication Handling**: Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, service accounts) per provider requirements\n- **Feature Availability**: Route advanced features (voice cloning, sound effects, speech marks) through provider-native APIs where supported, or return `unsupported-operation` errors for unavailable features\n- **Error Mapping**: Map provider-specific HTTP errors and API responses to the unified `tts-error` enumeration with appropriate context preservation\n- **Rate Limiting**: Handle provider-specific rate limits and quota management, implementing appropriate retry logic and error reporting\n- **Long-form Content**: Implement efficient handling of long-form synthesis using provider-native async operations (AWS Polly) or intelligent chunking strategies\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nEach implementation must include comprehensive test suites covering:\n- Basic synthesis operations (text-to-speech with various voices and configurations)\n- Voice discovery and metadata retrieval\n- Streaming synthesis lifecycle (session creation, chunk processing, cleanup)\n- Advanced feature testing (voice cloning, sound effects, custom pronunciations where supported)\n- Audio format validation and quality verification\n- Authentication and authorization scenarios\n- Error handling for unsupported operations and malformed inputs\n- Rate limiting and quota management behavior\n- Connection management and retry logic\n- Long-form content synthesis (>5000 characters)\n- Durability semantics verification across operation boundaries\n- Provider-specific feature utilization (lexicons for Polly, voice settings for ElevenLabs, etc.)\n\n## Configuration Requirements\n\nEach implementation should support the following environment variables:\n\n### Common Configuration\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT`: Custom endpoint URL (for enterprise/regional deployments)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)\n\n### Provider-Specific Configuration\n- **ElevenLabs**: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_MODEL_VERSION`\n- **AWS Polly**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`\n- **Google Cloud**: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`\n- **Deepgram**: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_VERSION`\n\n```wit\npackage

              "body": "I have attached to this ticket a WIT file that describes a generic interface for text-to-speech operations. This interface can be implemented by various providers, either by emulating features not present in a given provider, utilizing the provider's native support for a feature, or indicating an error if a particular combination is not natively supported by a provider.\n\nThe intent of this WIT specification is to allow developers of WASM components (on wasmCloud, Spin, or Golem) to leverage text-to-speech capabilities to build voice-powered applications, accessibility services, and audio content generation systems in a portable and provider-agnostic fashion.\n\nThis ticket involves constructing implementations of this WIT interface for the following providers:\n\n- **ElevenLabs**: The leading AI voice synthesis platform with comprehensive voice cloning, real-time streaming, voice conversion, and sound effects generation capabilities.\n- **AWS Polly**: Amazon's enterprise text-to-speech service with extensive language support, custom lexicons, speech marks, and asynchronous synthesis for long-form content.\n- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech**: Google's neural voice synthesis service with WaveNet and Neural2 voices, device optimization profiles, and streaming synthesis capabilities.\n- **Deepgram Aura**: High-performance real-time TTS with session-based streaming, low-latency neural voices, and conversational AI optimization.\n\nThese implementations must be written in Rust and compilable to WASM Components (WASI 0.23 only, since Golem does not yet support WASI 0.3). The standard Rust toolchain for WASM component development can be employed (see cargo component and the Rust examples of components in this and other Golem repositories).\n\nAdditionally, these implementations should incorporate custom durability semantics using the Golem durability API and the Golem host API. This approach ensures that durability is managed at the level of individual TTS operations (voice synthesis, streaming session creation, voice cloning, batch processing), providing a higher-level and clearer operation log, which aids in debugging and monitoring. See golem:llm and golem:embed for more details and durable implementations in this same repository.\n\nThe final deliverables associated with this ticket are:\n\n- **ElevenLabs implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-elevenlabs.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **AWS Polly implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-polly.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Google Cloud TTS implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-google.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Deepgram Aura implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-deepgram.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n\n**Note**: If you have a strong recommendation to swap out one or two of these with other popular / common TTS providers (such as Azure Cognitive Services Speech, IBM Watson Text to Speech, or OpenAI TTS), then as long as you get permission beforehand, that's okay with me. However, we definitely need ElevenLabs and AWS Polly.\n\nThese components will require runtime configuration, notably API keys, endpoint URLs, authentication credentials, and provider-specific settings. For configuring this information, the components can use environment variables for now (in the future, they will use wasi-runtime-config, but Golem does not support this yet, whereas Golem has good support for environment variables).\n\nMoreover, the Rust components need to be tested within Golem to ensure compatibility with Golem 1.2.x.\n\nThis WIT has been designed by examining and comparing the APIs of ElevenLabs, AWS Polly, Google Cloud TTS, Azure Speech Services, OpenAI TTS, and Deepgram Aura. However, given there are no implementations, it is possible the provided WIT is not the optimal abstraction across all these providers. Therefore, deviations from the proposed design can be made. However, to be accepted, any deviation must be fully justified and deemed by Golem core contributors to be an improvement from the original specification.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\nEach provider implementation should handle the following key mapping considerations:\n\n- **Voice Management**: Map the unified voice resource to provider-specific voice identifiers, handle voice discovery and metadata appropriately for each provider's voice catalog structure\n- **Audio Format Conversion**: Implement native audio format support where available, or provide format conversion for unsupported output formats using audio processing libraries\n- **Streaming Implementation**: Utilize native streaming APIs where supported (ElevenLabs, Deepgram), or implement chunk-based synthesis for providers without native streaming support\n- **Authentication Handling**: Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, service accounts) per provider requirements\n- **Feature Availability**: Route advanced features (voice cloning, sound effects, speech marks) through provider-native APIs where supported, or return `unsupported-operation` errors for unavailable features\n- **Error Mapping**: Map provider-specific HTTP errors and API responses to the unified `tts-error` enumeration with appropriate context preservation\n- **Rate Limiting**: Handle provider-specific rate limits and quota management, implementing appropriate retry logic and error reporting\n- **Long-form Content**: Implement efficient handling of long-form synthesis using provider-native async operations (AWS Polly) or intelligent chunking strategies\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nEach implementation must include comprehensive test suites covering:\n- Basic synthesis operations (text-to-speech with various voices and configurations)\n- Voice discovery and metadata retrieval\n- Streaming synthesis lifecycle (session creation, chunk processing, cleanup)\n- Advanced feature testing (voice cloning, sound effects, custom pronunciations where supported)\n- Audio format validation and quality verification\n- Authentication and authorization scenarios\n- Error handling for unsupported operations and malformed inputs\n- Rate limiting and quota management behavior\n- Connection management and retry logic\n- Long-form content synthesis (>5000 characters)\n- Durability semantics verification across operation boundaries\n- Provider-specific feature utilization (lexicons for Polly, voice settings for ElevenLabs, etc.)\n\n## Configuration Requirements\n\nEach implementation should support the following environment variables:\n\n### Common Configuration\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT`: Custom endpoint URL (for enterprise/regional deployments)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)\n\n### Provider-Specific Configuration\n- **ElevenLabs**: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_MODEL_VERSION`\n- **AWS Polly**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`\n- **Google Cloud**: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`\n- **Deepgram**: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_VERSION`\n\n```wit\npackage

                  "title": "Implement Durable Text-to-Speech Provider Components for golem:tts WIT Interface",
                  "body": "I have attached to this ticket a WIT file that describes a generic interface for text-to-speech operations. This interface can be implemented by various providers, either by emulating features not present in a given provider, utilizing the provider's native support for a feature, or indicating an error if a particular combination is not natively supported by a provider.\n\nThe intent of this WIT specification is to allow developers of WASM components (on wasmCloud, Spin, or Golem) to leverage text-to-speech capabilities to build voice-powered applications, accessibility services, and audio content generation systems in a portable and provider-agnostic fashion.\n\nThis ticket involves constructing implementations of this WIT interface for the following providers:\n\n- **ElevenLabs**: The leading AI voice synthesis platform with comprehensive voice cloning, real-time streaming, voice conversion, and sound effects generation capabilities.\n- **AWS Polly**: Amazon's enterprise text-to-speech service with extensive language support, custom lexicons, speech marks, and asynchronous synthesis for long-form content.\n- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech**: Google's neural voice synthesis service with WaveNet and Neural2 voices, device optimization profiles, and streaming synthesis capabilities.\n- **Deepgram Aura**: High-performance real-time TTS with session-based streaming, low-latency neural voices, and conversational AI optimization.\n\nThese implementations must be written in Rust and compilable to WASM Components (WASI 0.23 only, since Golem does not yet support WASI 0.3). The standard Rust toolchain for WASM component development can be employed (see cargo component and the Rust examples of components in this and other Golem repositories).\n\nAdditionally, these implementations should incorporate custom durability semantics using the Golem durability API and the Golem host API. This approach ensures that durability is managed at the level of individual TTS operations (voice synthesis, streaming session creation, voice cloning, batch processing), providing a higher-level and clearer operation log, which aids in debugging and monitoring. See golem:llm and golem:embed for more details and durable implementations in this same repository.\n\nThe final deliverables associated with this ticket are:\n\n- **ElevenLabs implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-elevenlabs.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **AWS Polly implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-polly.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Google Cloud TTS implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-google.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Deepgram Aura implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-deepgram.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n\n**Note**: If you have a strong recommendation to swap out one or two of these with other popular / common TTS providers (such as Azure Cognitive Services Speech, IBM Watson Text to Speech, or OpenAI TTS), then as long as you get permission beforehand, that's okay with me. However, we definitely need ElevenLabs and AWS Polly.\n\nThese components will require runtime configuration, notably API keys, endpoint URLs, authentication credentials, and provider-specific settings. For configuring this information, the components can use environment variables for now (in the future, they will use wasi-runtime-config, but Golem does not support this yet, whereas Golem has good support for environment variables).\n\nMoreover, the Rust components need to be tested within Golem to ensure compatibility with Golem 1.2.x.\n\nThis WIT has been designed by examining and comparing the APIs of ElevenLabs, AWS Polly, Google Cloud TTS, Azure Speech Services, OpenAI TTS, and Deepgram Aura. However, given there are no implementations, it is possible the provided WIT is not the optimal abstraction across all these providers. Therefore, deviations from the proposed design can be made. However, to be accepted, any deviation must be fully justified and deemed by Golem core contributors to be an improvement from the original specification.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\nEach provider implementation should handle the following key mapping considerations:\n\n- **Voice Management**: Map the unified voice resource to provider-specific voice identifiers, handle voice discovery and metadata appropriately for each provider's voice catalog structure\n- **Audio Format Conversion**: Implement native audio format support where available, or provide format conversion for unsupported output formats using audio processing libraries\n- **Streaming Implementation**: Utilize native streaming APIs where supported (ElevenLabs, Deepgram), or implement chunk-based synthesis for providers without native streaming support\n- **Authentication Handling**: Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, service accounts) per provider requirements\n- **Feature Availability**: Route advanced features (voice cloning, sound effects, speech marks) through provider-native APIs where supported, or return `unsupported-operation` errors for unavailable features\n- **Error Mapping**: Map provider-specific HTTP errors and API responses to the unified `tts-error` enumeration with appropriate context preservation\n- **Rate Limiting**: Handle provider-specific rate limits and quota management, implementing appropriate retry logic and error reporting\n- **Long-form Content**: Implement efficient handling of long-form synthesis using provider-native async operations (AWS Polly) or intelligent chunking strategies\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nEach implementation must include comprehensive test suites covering:\n- Basic synthesis operations (text-to-speech with various voices and configurations)\n- Voice discovery and metadata retrieval\n- Streaming synthesis lifecycle (session creation, chunk processing, cleanup)\n- Advanced feature testing (voice cloning, sound effects, custom pronunciations where supported)\n- Audio format validation and quality verification\n- Authentication and authorization scenarios\n- Error handling for unsupported operations and malformed inputs\n- Rate limiting and quota management behavior\n- Connection management and retry logic\n- Long-form content synthesis (>5000 characters)\n- Durability semantics verification across operation boundaries\n- Provider-specific feature utilization (lexicons for Polly, voice settings for ElevenLabs, etc.)\n\n## Configuration Requirements\n\nEach implementation should support the following environment variables:\n\n### Common Configuration\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT`: Custom endpoint URL (for enterprise/regional deployments)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)\n\n### Provider-Specific Configuration\n- **ElevenLabs**: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_MODEL_VERSION`\n- **AWS Polly**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`\n- **Google Cloud**: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`\n- **Deepgram**: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_VERSION`\n\n```wit\npackage

              "body": "I have attached to this ticket a WIT file that describes a generic interface for text-to-speech operations. This interface can be implemented by various providers, either by emulating features not present in a given provider, utilizing the provider's native support for a feature, or indicating an error if a particular combination is not natively supported by a provider.\n\nThe intent of this WIT specification is to allow developers of WASM components (on wasmCloud, Spin, or Golem) to leverage text-to-speech capabilities to build voice-powered applications, accessibility services, and audio content generation systems in a portable and provider-agnostic fashion.\n\nThis ticket involves constructing implementations of this WIT interface for the following providers:\n\n- **ElevenLabs**: The leading AI voice synthesis platform with comprehensive voice cloning, real-time streaming, voice conversion, and sound effects generation capabilities.\n- **AWS Polly**: Amazon's enterprise text-to-speech service with extensive language support, custom lexicons, speech marks, and asynchronous synthesis for long-form content.\n- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech**: Google's neural voice synthesis service with WaveNet and Neural2 voices, device optimization profiles, and streaming synthesis capabilities.\n- **Deepgram Aura**: High-performance real-time TTS with session-based streaming, low-latency neural voices, and conversational AI optimization.\n\nThese implementations must be written in Rust and compilable to WASM Components (WASI 0.23 only, since Golem does not yet support WASI 0.3). The standard Rust toolchain for WASM component development can be employed (see cargo component and the Rust examples of components in this and other Golem repositories).\n\nAdditionally, these implementations should incorporate custom durability semantics using the Golem durability API and the Golem host API. This approach ensures that durability is managed at the level of individual TTS operations (voice synthesis, streaming session creation, voice cloning, batch processing), providing a higher-level and clearer operation log, which aids in debugging and monitoring. See golem:llm and golem:embed for more details and durable implementations in this same repository.\n\nThe final deliverables associated with this ticket are:\n\n- **ElevenLabs implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-elevenlabs.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **AWS Polly implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-polly.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Google Cloud TTS implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-google.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Deepgram Aura implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-deepgram.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n\n**Note**: If you have a strong recommendation to swap out one or two of these with other popular / common TTS providers (such as Azure Cognitive Services Speech, IBM Watson Text to Speech, or OpenAI TTS), then as long as you get permission beforehand, that's okay with me. However, we definitely need ElevenLabs and AWS Polly.\n\nThese components will require runtime configuration, notably API keys, endpoint URLs, authentication credentials, and provider-specific settings. For configuring this information, the components can use environment variables for now (in the future, they will use wasi-runtime-config, but Golem does not support this yet, whereas Golem has good support for environment variables).\n\nMoreover, the Rust components need to be tested within Golem to ensure compatibility with Golem 1.2.x.\n\nThis WIT has been designed by examining and comparing the APIs of ElevenLabs, AWS Polly, Google Cloud TTS, Azure Speech Services, OpenAI TTS, and Deepgram Aura. However, given there are no implementations, it is possible the provided WIT is not the optimal abstraction across all these providers. Therefore, deviations from the proposed design can be made. However, to be accepted, any deviation must be fully justified and deemed by Golem core contributors to be an improvement from the original specification.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\nEach provider implementation should handle the following key mapping considerations:\n\n- **Voice Management**: Map the unified voice resource to provider-specific voice identifiers, handle voice discovery and metadata appropriately for each provider's voice catalog structure\n- **Audio Format Conversion**: Implement native audio format support where available, or provide format conversion for unsupported output formats using audio processing libraries\n- **Streaming Implementation**: Utilize native streaming APIs where supported (ElevenLabs, Deepgram), or implement chunk-based synthesis for providers without native streaming support\n- **Authentication Handling**: Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, service accounts) per provider requirements\n- **Feature Availability**: Route advanced features (voice cloning, sound effects, speech marks) through provider-native APIs where supported, or return `unsupported-operation` errors for unavailable features\n- **Error Mapping**: Map provider-specific HTTP errors and API responses to the unified `tts-error` enumeration with appropriate context preservation\n- **Rate Limiting**: Handle provider-specific rate limits and quota management, implementing appropriate retry logic and error reporting\n- **Long-form Content**: Implement efficient handling of long-form synthesis using provider-native async operations (AWS Polly) or intelligent chunking strategies\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nEach implementation must include comprehensive test suites covering:\n- Basic synthesis operations (text-to-speech with various voices and configurations)\n- Voice discovery and metadata retrieval\n- Streaming synthesis lifecycle (session creation, chunk processing, cleanup)\n- Advanced feature testing (voice cloning, sound effects, custom pronunciations where supported)\n- Audio format validation and quality verification\n- Authentication and authorization scenarios\n- Error handling for unsupported operations and malformed inputs\n- Rate limiting and quota management behavior\n- Connection management and retry logic\n- Long-form content synthesis (>5000 characters)\n- Durability semantics verification across operation boundaries\n- Provider-specific feature utilization (lexicons for Polly, voice settings for ElevenLabs, etc.)\n\n## Configuration Requirements\n\nEach implementation should support the following environment variables:\n\n### Common Configuration\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT`: Custom endpoint URL (for enterprise/regional deployments)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)\n\n### Provider-Specific Configuration\n- **ElevenLabs**: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_MODEL_VERSION`\n- **AWS Polly**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`\n- **Google Cloud**: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`\n- **Deepgram**: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_VERSION`\n\n```wit\npackage

This is making it so I can't use the integration.\r\n\r\nWe also use Fastmail and have been seeing some oddities with the [cal.com](http://cal.com/) integration. Namely, that participants are receiving multiple calendar invites, which on it's own isn't that big of a deal. However, the Fastmail invites are always in UTC, not in the local time of the cal.com invite.\r\n\r\nThis is creating a lot of confusion with participants, they keep missing our meetings, not realizing one invite is UTC and one in local time. I spoke with the Fastmail team and they relayed the following notes about cal's specific integration.\r\n\r\n1. There is a property (SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT) a CalDAV client can add to the event that would prevent CalDAV servers from sending invitations. It appears cal.com is not setting this property even though they are sending an invitation.\r\n2. The invitation being sent by [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is using a different UID. Basically every event has a UID that uniquely identifies the event. Since [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is sending the invitation of the event with a different UID, if you end up adding this event to your calendar [cal.com](http://cal.com/), it will create a duplicate event in your calendar as well. They need to fix it so that all emails associated with a single event use the same original UID.\r\n3. The event added from [cal.com](http://cal.com/) doesn't have a timezone associated with it. Though it mentions the invitees timezone as \"America/Chicago\" in the notes, the event itself doesn't include a timezone and only specifies the time in UTC. Since the event time is specified in UTC, Fastmail's invitation email will also be sent in UTC.\r\n4. There seems to be no way to stop Cal.com from creating the calendar events at all, and thus no real workaround.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Connect to Fastmail using CalDav integration\r\n2. Create a test booking\r\n3. See issues above.\r\n\r\nAny other relevant information. For example, why do you consider this a bug and what did you expect to happen instead?\r\n1. SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT should be set, so Fastmail knows not to send an invitation. **This is the main one.**\r\n2. UID should be unique per event.\r\n3. Event time should have a timezone associated with it.\r\n4. An option could be added to make calendar event creation optional (nice-to-have, not essential).\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\n\r\nNone other than Fastmail/CalDAV.",

                  "body": "# Structural Type Schema Support\n\n## Overview\n\nExtend `Schema[A]` to support structural types, enabling schema derivation for types defined by their structure rather than their nominal identity. This allows for duck-typed schema validation and conversion between nominal and structural representations.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Direct Structural Schema Derivation\n\nSchemas can be derived directly for structural types:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 3\ntype Person = { def name: String; def age: Int }\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\n\n// Scala 2\ntype Person = { def name: String; def age: Int }\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\n```\n\n**Note**: Both Scala 2 and Scala 3 use `def` for uniformity, even though Scala 3 supports `val` in structural types.\n\n**Implementation**: Schemas have bindings, which allow construction / deconstruction of values. Values for structural types are backed by:\n- **Scala 3**: `Selectable` \n- **Scala 2**: `Dynamic`\n\n### Nominal to Structural Conversion\n\nConvert nominal type schemas to their structural equivalents:\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Get the structural schema corresponding to Person's shape\nval structuralSchema: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Schema.derived[Person].structural\n```\n\n### Schema API Extension\n\n```scala\ncase class Schema[A](/* existing fields */) {\n  /**\n   * Convert this schema to a structural type schema.\n   * \n   * The structural type represents the \"shape\" of A without its nominal identity.\n   * This enables duck typing and structural validation.\n   * \n   * @param toStructural Macro-generated conversion to structural representation\n   * @return Schema for the structural type corresponding to A\n   */\n  def structural(implicit toStructural: ToStructural[A]): Schema[toStructural.StructuralType] = \n    toStructural.apply(this)\n}\n\n/**\n * Type class for converting nominal schemas to structural schemas.\n * Generated by macro for all supported types. Macro fails if a structural\n * type cannot be generated.\n *\n * NOTE: This approach has to be tested to yield inferrable types, and revised\n * if necessary. Inferrable types (from calling Schema#structural) are a must-have.\n */\ntrait ToStructural[A] {\n  type StructuralType\n  def apply(schema: Schema[A]): Schema[StructuralType]\n}\n\nobject ToStructural {\n  type Aux[A, S] = ToStructural[A] { type StructuralType = S }\n  \n  // Scala 3\n  transparent inline given [A]: ToStructural[A] = ${toStructuralMacro[A]}\n  \n  // Scala 2\n  implicit def materialize[A]: ToStructural[A] = macro toStructuralImpl[A]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n### 1. Simple Product Types\n\n#### Case Class to Structural\n\n```scala\n// Both Scala 2 and Scala 3\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Original nominal schema\nval nominalSchema: Schema[Person] = Schema.derived[Person]\n\n// Convert to structural\nval structuralSchema: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  nominalSchema.structural\n\n// Direct structural derivation (equivalent)\nval directStructural: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Schema.derived[{ def name: String; def age: Int }]\n```\n\n### 2. Nested Structures\n\n```scala\ncase class Address(street: String, city: String, zip: Int)\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int, address: Address)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ \n//   def name: String\n//   def age: Int\n//   def address: { def street: String; def city: String; def zip: Int }\n// }]\n```\n\n### 3. Collections and Options\n\n```scala\ncase class Team(name: String, members: List[String], leader: Option[String])\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Team].structural\n// Type: Schema[{\n//   def name: String\n//   def members: List[String]\n//   def leader: Option[String]\n// }]\n```\n\n### 4. Tuples to Structural\n\n```scala\n// Tuples can be converted to structural types\nval tupleSchema: Schema[(String, Int, Boolean)] = Schema.derived[(String, Int, Boolean)]\n\nval structuralSchema = tupleSchema.structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def _1: String; def _2: Int; def _3: Boolean }]\n```\n\n### 5. Sum Types (Sealed Traits) - Scala 3 Only\n\nSealed traits become union types of structural representations, with tag information stored at the type level:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 3 only\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Result].structural\n// Type: Schema[\n//   { type Tag = \"Success\"; def value: Int } | { type Tag = \"Failure\"; def error: String }\n// ]\n```\n\n**Note**: Sum type to structural conversion is **not supported in Scala 2** because it requires union types. Attempting to call `.structural` on a sealed trait schema in Scala 2 will result in a compile-time error.\n\n### 6. Enums (Scala 3 Only)\n\n```scala\nenum Status:\n  case Active, Inactive, Suspended\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Status].structural\n// Type: Schema[{type Tag = \"Active\"} | {type Tag = \"Inactive\"} | {type Tag = \"Suspended\"}]\n```\n\n### 7. Opaque Types (Scala 3)\n\n```scala\nopaque type UserId = String\nobject UserId:\n  def apply(value: String): Either[String, UserId] = \n    if value.nonEmpty then Right(value) else Left(\"Empty user ID\")\n\ncase class User(id: UserId, name: String)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[User].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def id: String; def name: String }]\n// Opaque type is unwrapped to its underlying type\n```\n\n### 8. Bidirectional Conversion\n\nStructural schemas work seamlessly with `Into`/`As` (if this ticket is implemented **after** that ticket):\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n\n// Create structural value (Scala 3)\nval structuralPerson = new Selectable {\n  def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n    case \"name\" => \"Alice\"\n    case \"age\" => 30\n  }\n}\n\n// Convert structural to nominal using Into\nval person: Either[SchemaError, Person] = \n  Into[{ def name: String; def age: Int }, Person].into(structuralPerson)\n// => Right(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n\n// Convert nominal to structural\nval backToStructural: Either[SchemaError, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Into[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }].into(Person(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n### 9. Empty and Single-Field Products\n\n```scala\n// Empty case class\ncase class Empty()\nval emptyStructural = Schema.derived[Empty].structural\n// Type: Schema[{}]\n\n// Single field\ncase class Id(value: String)\nval idStructural = Schema.derived[Id].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def value: String }]\n```\n\n### 10. Large Products\n\n```scala\ncase class LargeRecord(\n  f1: String, f2: Int, f3: Boolean, f4: Double, f5: Long,\n  f6: String, f7: Int, f8: Boolean, f9: Double, f10: Long,\n  f11: String, f12: Int, f13: Boolean, f14: Double, f15: Long,\n  f16: String, f17: Int, f18: Boolean, f19: Double, f20: Long,\n  f21: String\n)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[LargeRecord].structural\n// Type: Schema[{\n//   def f1: String; def f2: Int; def f3: Boolean; ...\n//   def f21: String\n// }]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Type Name Handling\n\n### Current Limitation\n\nSchemas currently use `TypeName[A]` to identify types. Structural types don't have meaningful nominal type names, which creates a mismatch.\n\n### Temporary Solution\n\nUntil `TypeName[A]` is replaced with `TypeId[A]` (see issue #471), structural schemas will use a normalized string representation of the structural type as a fake type name:\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\nschema.typeName // => TypeName for \"Person\"\n\nval structural = schema.structural\nstructural.typeName // => TypeName for \"{age:Int,name:String}\"\n// Normalized: fields sorted alphabetically, types fully qualified\n```\n\n### Normalization Rules\n\n1. **Field ordering**: Alphabetical by field name\n2. **Type qualification**: Use simple names for primitives and standard library types\n3. **Whitespace**: No whitespace in generated names\n4. **Collections**: Standard notation (e.g., `List[Int]`)\n5. **Options**: Explicit `Option[T]` notation\n6. **Nested structures**: Recursive application of rules\n7. **Deterministic**: Same structure always produces same normalized name\n\n### Examples\n\n```scala\n// Simple product\ncase class Point(x: Int, y: Int)\nSchema.derived[Point].structural.typeName \n// => \"{x:Int,y:Int}\"\n\n// Nested product\ncase class Address(street: String, zip: Int)\ncase class Person(name: String, address: Address)\nSchema.derived[Person].structural.typeName\n// => \"{address:{street:String,zip:Int},name:String}\"\n\n// With collections\ncase class Team(name: String, members: List[String])\nSchema.derived[Team].structural.typeName\n// => \"{members:List[String],name:String}\"\n\n// Union type (Scala 3)\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\nSchema.derived[Result].structural.typeName\n// => \"{error:String}|{value:Int}\"\n```\n\n### Future: TypeId[A]\n\nThe upcoming `TypeId[A]` replacement will properly handle structural types by representing them by their structure rather than a string-based hack. See issue #471 for details.\n\n---\n\n## Limitations and Edge Cases\n\n### 1. Generic Types\n\n**Behavior depends on existing Schema derivation support for generic types.**\n\nIf `Schema.derived[Container[Int]]` already works, then structural conversion should work:\n\n```scala\ncase class Container[T](value: T)\n\n// If this works:\nval schema = Schema.derived[Container[Int]]\n\n// Then this should work:\nval structural = schema.structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def value: Int }]\n```\n\nIf generic type derivation is not currently supported, this ticket **does not require implementing it**. The macro should produce a clear compile-time error for unsupported generic types.\n\n### 2. Recursive Types\n\nRecursive types will **fail at compile-time** because Scala does not support infinite types:\n\n```scala\ncase class Tree(value: Int, children: List[Tree])\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time:\nval structural = Schema.derived[Tree].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate infinite structural type\n\n// The structural type would need to be:\n// { def value: Int; def children: List[{ def value: Int; def children: List[...] }] }\n// which is infinite and unsupported\n```\n\nThe macro must detect recursive types and produce a helpful error message:\n\n```\nCompile error: Cannot generate structural type for recursive type Tree.\nStructural types cannot represent recursive structures.\n```\n\n### 3. Mutually Recursive Types\n\nSimilarly, mutually recursive types are unsupported:\n\n```scala\ncase class Node(id: Int, edges: List[Edge])\ncase class Edge(from: Int, to: Node)\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time:\nval nodeStructural = Schema.derived[Node].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate structural type for mutually recursive types\n```\n\n### 4. Sum Types in Scala 2\n\nSealed traits and sum types **cannot be converted to structural types in Scala 2** because they require union types:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 2\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time in Scala 2:\nval structural = Schema.derived[Result].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate structural type for sum types in Scala 2.\n// Union types are required, which are only available in Scala 3.\n```\n\nThe macro must detect sum types in Scala 2 and produce a clear error.\n\n### 5. Case Objects\n\nCase objects become empty structural types:\n\n```scala\ncase object Singleton\n\nval structural = Schema.derived[Singleton.type].structural\n// Type: Schema[{}]\n```\n\nFor sum types with case objects (Scala 3):\n\n```scala\nsealed trait Status\ncase object Active extends Status\ncase object Inactive extends Status\n\nval structural = Schema.derived[Status].structural\n// Type: Schema[{} | {}]\n// Not particularly useful, but valid\n```\n\n### 6. Structural Types as Source\n\nDeriving schemas directly for structural types is supported:\n\n```scala\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\nval schema = Schema.derived[PersonStructure]\n// Should work if structural type derivation is implemented\n```\n\nThe schema's bindings will use `Selectable` (Scala 3) or `Dynamic` (Scala 2) to construct and deconstruct values.\n\n---\n\n## Integration with Into/As\n\nStructural schemas compose naturally with `Into`/`As` conversions.\n\n### Nominal → Structural\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Auto-derived conversion\nval nominalToStructural: Into[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Into.derived\n\nval person = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\nval structural = nominalToStructural.into(person)\n// => Right(<Selectable/Dynamic instance>)\n```\n\n### Structural → Nominal\n\n```scala\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Auto-derived conversion\nval structuralToNominal: Into[PersonStructure, Person] = \n  Into.derived\n\nval structural: PersonStructure = new Selectable {\n  def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n    case \"name\" => \"Bob\"\n    case \"age\" => 25\n  }\n}\n\nval person = structuralToNominal.into(structural)\n// => Right(Person(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n### Bidirectional (As)\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Bidirectional conversion\nval personAs: As[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  As.derived\n\n// Nominal → Structural\nval structural = personAs.into(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n\n// Structural → Nominal\nval nominal = structural.flatMap(personAs.from)\n// Round-trip successful\n```\n\n### Schema-Guided Conversion\n\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(firstName: String, lastName: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Use structural type as intermediary\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\n// Step 1: Transform V1 to structural (custom logic)\nval v1ToStructural: Into[PersonV1, PersonStructure] = \n  new Into[PersonV1, PersonStructure] {\n    def into(v1: PersonV1): Either[SchemaError, PersonStructure] = {\n      Right(new Selectable {\n        def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n          case \"name\" => s\"${v1.firstName} ${v1.lastName}\"\n          case \"age\" => v1.age\n        }\n      })\n    }\n  }\n\n// Step 2: Auto-convert structural to V2\nval structuralToV2: Into[PersonStructure, PersonV2] = Into.derived\n\n// Composed migration\ndef migrate(v1: PersonV1): Either[SchemaError, PersonV2] = {\n  v1ToStructural.into(v1).flatMap(structuralToV2.into)\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Matrix\n\n1. **Direct Structural Derivation**\n   - Simple products (case classes)\n   - Nested products\n   - Collections (List, Vector, Set, Map, Option, Either)\n   - Tuples (2-22 elements)\n   - Empty case classes\n   - Single-field case classes\n   - Large products (20+ fields)\n   - Case objects\n\n2. **Nominal to Structural Conversion**\n   - Case class → structural\n   - Tuple → structural\n   - Nested case classes → nested structural\n   - Case class with collections → structural with collections\n   - Empty case class → empty structural\n\n3. **Sum Types (Scala 3 Only)**\n   - Sealed trait → union type structural\n   - Sealed trait with case objects\n   - Enum → union type structural\n   - Nested sum types\n\n4. **Type Name Generation**\n   - Simple product normalized name\n   - Nested product normalized name\n   - Name determinism (same structure = same name)\n   - Alphabetical field ordering in names\n   - Union type names (Scala 3)\n\n5. **Selectable/Dynamic Implementation**\n   - Scala 3 Selectable field access\n   - Scala 2 Dynamic field access\n   - Field access correctness\n   - Missing field behavior\n   - Extra field behavior\n\n6. **Integration with Into/As**\n   - Nominal → Structural via Into\n   - Structural → Nominal via Into\n   - Round-trip via As\n   - Composed conversions with structural intermediary\n\n7. **Error Cases (Compile-Time)**\n   - Recursive types produce error\n   - Mutually recursive types produce error\n   - Sum types in Scala 2 produce error\n   - Unsupported types produce helpful errors\n\n8. **Generic Types** (if supported by existing Schema derivation)\n   - Fully applied generic → structural\n   - Generic with nested structural fields\n\n### Scala 2 vs Scala 3 Test Separation\n\n```\nsrc/test/scala/\n  structural/\n    common/\n      SimpleProductSpec.scala\n      NestedProductSpec.scala\n      CollectionsSpec.scala\n      TuplesSpec.scala\n      EmptyProductSpec.scala\n      SingleFieldSpec.scala\n      LargeProductSpec.scala\n      TypeNameNormalizationSpec.scala\n      IntoIntegrationSpec.scala\n      AsIntegrationSpec.scala\n      \n    scala3/\n      UnionTypesSpec.scala\n      SealedTraitToUnionSpec.scala\n      EnumToUnionSpec.scala\n      SelectableImplementationSpec.scala\n      \n    scala2/\n      DynamicImplementationSpec.scala\n      SumTypeErrorSpec.scala (verifies compile error)\n      \n    errors/\n      RecursiveTypeErrorSpec.scala\n      MutualRecursionErrorSpec.scala\n      UnsupportedTypeErrorSpec.scala\n```\n\n### Test Examples\n\n```scala\n// Test: Simple product to structural\ntest(\"case class converts to structural schema\") {\n  case class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n  \n  val structural = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n  \n  // Type check (this is a compile-time test)\n  val _: Schema[{ def name: String;

              "body": "# Structural Type Schema Support\n\n## Overview\n\nExtend `Schema[A]` to support structural types, enabling schema derivation for types defined by their structure rather than their nominal identity. This allows for duck-typed schema validation and conversion between nominal and structural representations.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Direct Structural Schema Derivation\n\nSchemas can be derived directly for structural types:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 3\ntype Person = { def name: String; def age: Int }\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\n\n// Scala 2\ntype Person = { def name: String; def age: Int }\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\n```\n\n**Note**: Both Scala 2 and Scala 3 use `def` for uniformity, even though Scala 3 supports `val` in structural types.\n\n**Implementation**: Schemas have bindings, which allow construction / deconstruction of values. Values for structural types are backed by:\n- **Scala 3**: `Selectable` \n- **Scala 2**: `Dynamic`\n\n### Nominal to Structural Conversion\n\nConvert nominal type schemas to their structural equivalents:\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Get the structural schema corresponding to Person's shape\nval structuralSchema: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Schema.derived[Person].structural\n```\n\n### Schema API Extension\n\n```scala\ncase class Schema[A](/* existing fields */) {\n  /**\n   * Convert this schema to a structural type schema.\n   * \n   * The structural type represents the \"shape\" of A without its nominal identity.\n   * This enables duck typing and structural validation.\n   * \n   * @param toStructural Macro-generated conversion to structural representation\n   * @return Schema for the structural type corresponding to A\n   */\n  def structural(implicit toStructural: ToStructural[A]): Schema[toStructural.StructuralType] = \n    toStructural.apply(this)\n}\n\n/**\n * Type class for converting nominal schemas to structural schemas.\n * Generated by macro for all supported types. Macro fails if a structural\n * type cannot be generated.\n *\n * NOTE: This approach has to be tested to yield inferrable types, and revised\n * if necessary. Inferrable types (from calling Schema#structural) are a must-have.\n */\ntrait ToStructural[A] {\n  type StructuralType\n  def apply(schema: Schema[A]): Schema[StructuralType]\n}\n\nobject ToStructural {\n  type Aux[A, S] = ToStructural[A] { type StructuralType = S }\n  \n  // Scala 3\n  transparent inline given [A]: ToStructural[A] = ${toStructuralMacro[A]}\n  \n  // Scala 2\n  implicit def materialize[A]: ToStructural[A] = macro toStructuralImpl[A]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n### 1. Simple Product Types\n\n#### Case Class to Structural\n\n```scala\n// Both Scala 2 and Scala 3\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Original nominal schema\nval nominalSchema: Schema[Person] = Schema.derived[Person]\n\n// Convert to structural\nval structuralSchema: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  nominalSchema.structural\n\n// Direct structural derivation (equivalent)\nval directStructural: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Schema.derived[{ def name: String; def age: Int }]\n```\n\n### 2. Nested Structures\n\n```scala\ncase class Address(street: String, city: String, zip: Int)\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int, address: Address)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ \n//   def name: String\n//   def age: Int\n//   def address: { def street: String; def city: String; def zip: Int }\n// }]\n```\n\n### 3. Collections and Options\n\n```scala\ncase class Team(name: String, members: List[String], leader: Option[String])\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Team].structural\n// Type: Schema[{\n//   def name: String\n//   def members: List[String]\n//   def leader: Option[String]\n// }]\n```\n\n### 4. Tuples to Structural\n\n```scala\n// Tuples can be converted to structural types\nval tupleSchema: Schema[(String, Int, Boolean)] = Schema.derived[(String, Int, Boolean)]\n\nval structuralSchema = tupleSchema.structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def _1: String; def _2: Int; def _3: Boolean }]\n```\n\n### 5. Sum Types (Sealed Traits) - Scala 3 Only\n\nSealed traits become union types of structural representations, with tag information stored at the type level:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 3 only\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Result].structural\n// Type: Schema[\n//   { type Tag = \"Success\"; def value: Int } | { type Tag = \"Failure\"; def error: String }\n// ]\n```\n\n**Note**: Sum type to structural conversion is **not supported in Scala 2** because it requires union types. Attempting to call `.structural` on a sealed trait schema in Scala 2 will result in a compile-time error.\n\n### 6. Enums (Scala 3 Only)\n\n```scala\nenum Status:\n  case Active, Inactive, Suspended\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Status].structural\n// Type: Schema[{type Tag = \"Active\"} | {type Tag = \"Inactive\"} | {type Tag = \"Suspended\"}]\n```\n\n### 7. Opaque Types (Scala 3)\n\n```scala\nopaque type UserId = String\nobject UserId:\n  def apply(value: String): Either[String, UserId] = \n    if value.nonEmpty then Right(value) else Left(\"Empty user ID\")\n\ncase class User(id: UserId, name: String)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[User].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def id: String; def name: String }]\n// Opaque type is unwrapped to its underlying type\n```\n\n### 8. Bidirectional Conversion\n\nStructural schemas work seamlessly with `Into`/`As` (if this ticket is implemented **after** that ticket):\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n\n// Create structural value (Scala 3)\nval structuralPerson = new Selectable {\n  def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n    case \"name\" => \"Alice\"\n    case \"age\" => 30\n  }\n}\n\n// Convert structural to nominal using Into\nval person: Either[SchemaError, Person] = \n  Into[{ def name: String; def age: Int }, Person].into(structuralPerson)\n// => Right(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n\n// Convert nominal to structural\nval backToStructural: Either[SchemaError, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Into[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }].into(Person(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n### 9. Empty and Single-Field Products\n\n```scala\n// Empty case class\ncase class Empty()\nval emptyStructural = Schema.derived[Empty].structural\n// Type: Schema[{}]\n\n// Single field\ncase class Id(value: String)\nval idStructural = Schema.derived[Id].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def value: String }]\n```\n\n### 10. Large Products\n\n```scala\ncase class LargeRecord(\n  f1: String, f2: Int, f3: Boolean, f4: Double, f5: Long,\n  f6: String, f7: Int, f8: Boolean, f9: Double, f10: Long,\n  f11: String, f12: Int, f13: Boolean, f14: Double, f15: Long,\n  f16: String, f17: Int, f18: Boolean, f19: Double, f20: Long,\n  f21: String\n)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[LargeRecord].structural\n// Type: Schema[{\n//   def f1: String; def f2: Int; def f3: Boolean; ...\n//   def f21: String\n// }]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Type Name Handling\n\n### Current Limitation\n\nSchemas currently use `TypeName[A]` to identify types. Structural types don't have meaningful nominal type names, which creates a mismatch.\n\n### Temporary Solution\n\nUntil `TypeName[A]` is replaced with `TypeId[A]` (see issue #471), structural schemas will use a normalized string representation of the structural type as a fake type name:\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\nschema.typeName // => TypeName for \"Person\"\n\nval structural = schema.structural\nstructural.typeName // => TypeName for \"{age:Int,name:String}\"\n// Normalized: fields sorted alphabetically, types fully qualified\n```\n\n### Normalization Rules\n\n1. **Field ordering**: Alphabetical by field name\n2. **Type qualification**: Use simple names for primitives and standard library types\n3. **Whitespace**: No whitespace in generated names\n4. **Collections**: Standard notation (e.g., `List[Int]`)\n5. **Options**: Explicit `Option[T]` notation\n6. **Nested structures**: Recursive application of rules\n7. **Deterministic**: Same structure always produces same normalized name\n\n### Examples\n\n```scala\n// Simple product\ncase class Point(x: Int, y: Int)\nSchema.derived[Point].structural.typeName \n// => \"{x:Int,y:Int}\"\n\n// Nested product\ncase class Address(street: String, zip: Int)\ncase class Person(name: String, address: Address)\nSchema.derived[Person].structural.typeName\n// => \"{address:{street:String,zip:Int},name:String}\"\n\n// With collections\ncase class Team(name: String, members: List[String])\nSchema.derived[Team].structural.typeName\n// => \"{members:List[String],name:String}\"\n\n// Union type (Scala 3)\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\nSchema.derived[Result].structural.typeName\n// => \"{error:String}|{value:Int}\"\n```\n\n### Future: TypeId[A]\n\nThe upcoming `TypeId[A]` replacement will properly handle structural types by representing them by their structure rather than a string-based hack. See issue #471 for details.\n\n---\n\n## Limitations and Edge Cases\n\n### 1. Generic Types\n\n**Behavior depends on existing Schema derivation support for generic types.**\n\nIf `Schema.derived[Container[Int]]` already works, then structural conversion should work:\n\n```scala\ncase class Container[T](value: T)\n\n// If this works:\nval schema = Schema.derived[Container[Int]]\n\n// Then this should work:\nval structural = schema.structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def value: Int }]\n```\n\nIf generic type derivation is not currently supported, this ticket **does not require implementing it**. The macro should produce a clear compile-time error for unsupported generic types.\n\n### 2. Recursive Types\n\nRecursive types will **fail at compile-time** because Scala does not support infinite types:\n\n```scala\ncase class Tree(value: Int, children: List[Tree])\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time:\nval structural = Schema.derived[Tree].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate infinite structural type\n\n// The structural type would need to be:\n// { def value: Int; def children: List[{ def value: Int; def children: List[...] }] }\n// which is infinite and unsupported\n```\n\nThe macro must detect recursive types and produce a helpful error message:\n\n```\nCompile error: Cannot generate structural type for recursive type Tree.\nStructural types cannot represent recursive structures.\n```\n\n### 3. Mutually Recursive Types\n\nSimilarly, mutually recursive types are unsupported:\n\n```scala\ncase class Node(id: Int, edges: List[Edge])\ncase class Edge(from: Int, to: Node)\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time:\nval nodeStructural = Schema.derived[Node].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate structural type for mutually recursive types\n```\n\n### 4. Sum Types in Scala 2\n\nSealed traits and sum types **cannot be converted to structural types in Scala 2** because they require union types:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 2\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time in Scala 2:\nval structural = Schema.derived[Result].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate structural type for sum types in Scala 2.\n// Union types are required, which are only available in Scala 3.\n```\n\nThe macro must detect sum types in Scala 2 and produce a clear error.\n\n### 5. Case Objects\n\nCase objects become empty structural types:\n\n```scala\ncase object Singleton\n\nval structural = Schema.derived[Singleton.type].structural\n// Type: Schema[{}]\n```\n\nFor sum types with case objects (Scala 3):\n\n```scala\nsealed trait Status\ncase object Active extends Status\ncase object Inactive extends Status\n\nval structural = Schema.derived[Status].structural\n// Type: Schema[{} | {}]\n// Not particularly useful, but valid\n```\n\n### 6. Structural Types as Source\n\nDeriving schemas directly for structural types is supported:\n\n```scala\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\nval schema = Schema.derived[PersonStructure]\n// Should work if structural type derivation is implemented\n```\n\nThe schema's bindings will use `Selectable` (Scala 3) or `Dynamic` (Scala 2) to construct and deconstruct values.\n\n---\n\n## Integration with Into/As\n\nStructural schemas compose naturally with `Into`/`As` conversions.\n\n### Nominal → Structural\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Auto-derived conversion\nval nominalToStructural: Into[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Into.derived\n\nval person = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\nval structural = nominalToStructural.into(person)\n// => Right(<Selectable/Dynamic instance>)\n```\n\n### Structural → Nominal\n\n```scala\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String;

This type should mirror the existing `DynamicPatch` implementation, adapted for JSON's simpler data model.\n\n## Motivation\n\n`DynamicValue` has a well-designed `DynamicPatch` system with:\n- Monoid composition (`++` with `empty` identity)\n- LCS-based sequence diffing\n- Primitive delta operations (numeric deltas, string edits)\n- Comprehensive algebraic laws verified by property tests\n\nThe proposed `Json` type (see #TBD) needs equivalent patching capabilities. Rather than converting `Json ↔ DynamicValue` for every patch operation, a native `JsonPatch` provides:\n- Type safety (no conversion errors for JSON-incompatible DynamicPatch operations)\n- API consistency with the `Json` type\n- Potential for JSON-specific optimizations\n\n## Design Sketch\n\nA design sketch is available at [`[schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala](https://claude.ai/chat/schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala)`](./schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala). This sketch is **a guide, not a specification** — implementers should use judgment and deviate where appropriate.\n\n### Core Types\n\nThe design mirrors `DynamicPatch` with JSON-specific adaptations:\n\n| DynamicPatch | JsonPatch | Notes |\n|--------------|-----------|-------|\n| `DynamicPatch(Vector[DynamicPatchOp])` | `JsonPatch(Vector[JsonPatchOp])` | Same structure |\n| `Operation.Set` | `Op.Set` | Same |\n| `Operation.PrimitiveDelta` | `Op.PrimitiveDelta` | Simplified for JSON types |\n| `Operation.SequenceEdit` | `Op.ArrayEdit` | Renamed |\n| `Operation.MapEdit` | `Op.ObjectEdit` | String keys only |\n| `Operation.Patch` | `Op.Nested` | Same |\n| `SeqOp` | `ArrayOp` | Same operations |\n| `MapOp` | `ObjectOp` | String keys only |\n| `PrimitiveOp` (14 variants) | `PrimitiveOp` (2 variants) | See below |\n\n### Primitive Operations\n\nJSON has a simpler type system than `DynamicValue`:\n\n| JSON Type | Delta Operation | Notes |\n|-----------|-----------------|-------|\n| Number | `NumberDelta(BigDecimal)` | Unifies all numeric deltas |\n| String | `StringEdit(Vector[StringOp])` | Same as `DynamicPatch` |\n| Boolean | Use `Op.Set` | No delta (same as `DynamicPatch`) |\n| Null | Use `Op.Set` | No delta |\n\n### StringOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.StringOp` exactly:\n- `Insert(index: Int, text: String)`\n- `Delete(index: Int, length: Int)`\n- `Append(text: String)`\n- `Modify(index: Int, length: Int, text: String)`\n\n### ArrayOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.SeqOp`:\n- `Insert(index: Int, values: Vector[Json])`\n- `Append(values: Vector[Json])`\n- `Delete(index: Int, count: Int)`\n- `Modify(index: Int, op: Op)`\n\n### ObjectOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.MapOp` with string keys:\n- `Add(key: String, value: Json)`\n- `Remove(key: String)`\n- `Modify(key: String, patch: JsonPatch)`\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- [ ] **F1**: `JsonPatch.diff(source, target)` computes a patch transforming source to target\n- [ ] **F2**: `patch.apply(json, mode)` applies a patch with configurable failure handling\n- [ ] **F3**: `patch1 ++ patch2` composes patches (apply first, then second)\n- [ ] **F4**: `JsonPatch.empty` is the identity element for composition\n- [ ] **F5**: Support `JsonPatchMode.Strict`, `Lenient`, and `Clobber` modes\n- [ ] **F6**: Bidirectional conversion: `toDynamicPatch` / `fromDynamicPatch`\n\n### Algebraic Laws\n\nAll laws must be verified with property-based tests (see `PatchLawsSpec` for reference):\n\n- [ ] **L1**: Left identity — `(empty ++ p)(j) == p(j)`\n- [ ] **L2**: Right identity — `(p ++ empty)(j) == p(j)`\n- [ ] **L3**: Associativity — `((p1 ++ p2) ++ p3)(j) == (p1 ++ (p2 ++ p3))(j)`\n- [ ] **L4**: Roundtrip — `diff(a, b)(a) == Right(b)`\n- [ ] **L5**: Identity diff — `diff(j, j).isEmpty`\n- [ ] **L6**: Diff composition — `(diff(a, b) ++ diff(b, c))(a) == Right(c)`\n- [ ] **L7**: Lenient subsumes Strict — if `p(j, Strict) == Right(r)` then `p(j, Lenient) == Right(r)`\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- [ ] **T1**: Property-based tests for all algebraic laws (see `PatchLawsSpec`)\n- [ ] **T2**: Test each operation type (`Set`, `PrimitiveDelta`, `ArrayEdit`, `ObjectEdit`, `Nested`)\n- [ ] **T3**: Test each `ArrayOp` variant (`Insert`, `Append`, `Delete`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T4**: Test each `ObjectOp` variant (`Add`, `Remove`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T5**: Test each `StringOp` variant (`Insert`, `Delete`, `Append`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T6**: Test `NumberDelta` with positive, negative, zero, and decimal deltas\n- [ ] **T7**: Test all three `JsonPatchMode` behaviors\n- [ ] **T8**: Test `toDynamicPatch` / `fromDynamicPatch` roundtrip\n- [ ] **T9**: Test edge cases: empty arrays, empty objects, empty strings, nested structures\n- [ ] **T10**: Test error cases: invalid paths, type mismatches, out-of-bounds indices\n\n### Documentation Requirements\n\n- [ ] **D1**: ScalaDoc for all public types and methods\n- [ ] **D2**: Usage examples in ScalaDoc (see sketch for examples)\n- [ ] **D3**: Document algebraic laws in type-level comments\n- [ ] **D4**: Document relationship to `DynamicPatch`\n\n## Related\n\n-

This type should mirror the existing `DynamicPatch` implementation, adapted for JSON's simpler data model.\n\n## Motivation\n\n`DynamicValue` has a well-designed `DynamicPatch` system with:\n- Monoid composition (`++` with `empty` identity)\n- LCS-based sequence diffing\n- Primitive delta operations (numeric deltas, string edits)\n- Comprehensive algebraic laws verified by property tests\n\nThe proposed `Json` type (see #TBD) needs equivalent patching capabilities. Rather than converting `Json ↔ DynamicValue` for every patch operation, a native `JsonPatch` provides:\n- Type safety (no conversion errors for JSON-incompatible DynamicPatch operations)\n- API consistency with the `Json` type\n- Potential for JSON-specific optimizations\n\n## Design Sketch\n\nA design sketch is available at [`[schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala](https://claude.ai/chat/schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala)`](./schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala). This sketch is **a guide, not a specification** — implementers should use judgment and deviate where appropriate.\n\n### Core Types\n\nThe design mirrors `DynamicPatch` with JSON-specific adaptations:\n\n| DynamicPatch | JsonPatch | Notes |\n|--------------|-----------|-------|\n| `DynamicPatch(Vector[DynamicPatchOp])` | `JsonPatch(Vector[JsonPatchOp])` | Same structure |\n| `Operation.Set` | `Op.Set` | Same |\n| `Operation.PrimitiveDelta` | `Op.PrimitiveDelta` | Simplified for JSON types |\n| `Operation.SequenceEdit` | `Op.ArrayEdit` | Renamed |\n| `Operation.MapEdit` | `Op.ObjectEdit` | String keys only |\n| `Operation.Patch` | `Op.Nested` | Same |\n| `SeqOp` | `ArrayOp` | Same operations |\n| `MapOp` | `ObjectOp` | String keys only |\n| `PrimitiveOp` (14 variants) | `PrimitiveOp` (2 variants) | See below |\n\n### Primitive Operations\n\nJSON has a simpler type system than `DynamicValue`:\n\n| JSON Type | Delta Operation | Notes |\n|-----------|-----------------|-------|\n| Number | `NumberDelta(BigDecimal)` | Unifies all numeric deltas |\n| String | `StringEdit(Vector[StringOp])` | Same as `DynamicPatch` |\n| Boolean | Use `Op.Set` | No delta (same as `DynamicPatch`) |\n| Null | Use `Op.Set` | No delta |\n\n### StringOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.StringOp` exactly:\n- `Insert(index: Int, text: String)`\n- `Delete(index: Int, length: Int)`\n- `Append(text: String)`\n- `Modify(index: Int, length: Int, text: String)`\n\n### ArrayOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.SeqOp`:\n- `Insert(index: Int, values: Vector[Json])`\n- `Append(values: Vector[Json])`\n- `Delete(index: Int, count: Int)`\n- `Modify(index: Int, op: Op)`\n\n### ObjectOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.MapOp` with string keys:\n- `Add(key: String, value: Json)`\n- `Remove(key: String)`\n- `Modify(key: String, patch: JsonPatch)`\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- [ ] **F1**: `JsonPatch.diff(source, target)` computes a patch transforming source to target\n- [ ] **F2**: `patch.apply(json, mode)` applies a patch with configurable failure handling\n- [ ] **F3**: `patch1 ++ patch2` composes patches (apply first, then second)\n- [ ] **F4**: `JsonPatch.empty` is the identity element for composition\n- [ ] **F5**: Support `JsonPatchMode.Strict`, `Lenient`, and `Clobber` modes\n- [ ] **F6**: Bidirectional conversion: `toDynamicPatch` / `fromDynamicPatch`\n\n### Algebraic Laws\n\nAll laws must be verified with property-based tests (see `PatchLawsSpec` for reference):\n\n- [ ] **L1**: Left identity — `(empty ++ p)(j) == p(j)`\n- [ ] **L2**: Right identity — `(p ++ empty)(j) == p(j)`\n- [ ] **L3**: Associativity — `((p1 ++ p2) ++ p3)(j) == (p1 ++ (p2 ++ p3))(j)`\n- [ ] **L4**: Roundtrip — `diff(a, b)(a) == Right(b)`\n- [ ] **L5**: Identity diff — `diff(j, j).isEmpty`\n- [ ] **L6**: Diff composition — `(diff(a, b) ++ diff(b, c))(a) == Right(c)`\n- [ ] **L7**: Lenient subsumes Strict — if `p(j, Strict) == Right(r)` then `p(j, Lenient) == Right(r)`\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- [ ] **T1**: Property-based tests for all algebraic laws (see `PatchLawsSpec`)\n- [ ] **T2**: Test each operation type (`Set`, `PrimitiveDelta`, `ArrayEdit`, `ObjectEdit`, `Nested`)\n- [ ] **T3**: Test each `ArrayOp` variant (`Insert`, `Append`, `Delete`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T4**: Test each `ObjectOp` variant (`Add`, `Remove`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T5**: Test each `StringOp` variant (`Insert`, `Delete`, `Append`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T6**: Test `NumberDelta` with positive, negative, zero, and decimal deltas\n- [ ] **T7**: Test all three `JsonPatchMode` behaviors\n- [ ] **T8**: Test `toDynamicPatch` / `fromDynamicPatch` roundtrip\n- [ ] **T9**: Test edge cases: empty arrays, empty objects, empty strings, nested structures\n- [ ] **T10**: Test error cases: invalid paths, type mismatches, out-of-bounds indices\n\n### Documentation Requirements\n\n- [ ] **D1**: ScalaDoc for all public types and methods\n- [ ] **D2**: Usage examples in ScalaDoc (see sketch for examples)\n- [ ] **D3**: Document algebraic laws in type-level comments\n- [ ] **D4**: Document relationship to `DynamicPatch`\n\n## Related\n\n-

                  "body": "## Overview\n\nImplement a **pure, algebraic migration system** for ZIO Schema 2 that represents **structural transformations between schema versions** as first-class, serializable data.\n\nA migration describes how to transform data from one schema version to another, enabling:\n\n* schema evolution\n* backward / forward compatibility\n* data versioning\n* offline migrations (JSON, SQL, data lakes, registries, etc.)\n\nThe system provides a **typed, macro-validated user API** (`Migration[A, B]`) built on a **pure, serializable core** (`DynamicMigration`) that operates on `DynamicValue`. \n\nThe ADT is fully introspectable and can be used to generate DDL, etc.\n\n## Motivation & Big Picture\n\n### Why structural types?\n\nWhen evolving schemas over time, **older versions of data types should not require runtime representations**.\n\nIn this design:\n\n* **Current versions** are represented by real case classes / enums\n* **Past versions** are represented using:\n\n  * **structural types** for records\n  * **abstract types + intersection types** for sum types\n\nThese types:\n\n* exist **only at compile time**\n* have **no runtime representation**\n* introduce **zero runtime overhead**\n* do **not require optics or instances to be kept around**\n\nThis allows you to describe arbitrarily old versions of data *without polluting your runtime or codebase*.\n\n#### Typical Workflow\n\nA typical workflow looks like:\n\n1. You have a current type:\n\n   ```scala\n   @schema\n   case class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n   ```\n\n2. You derive and copy its structural shape:\n\n   ```scala\n   type PersonV1 = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n   ```\n\n3. You evolve the real type:\n\n   ```scala\n   @schema\n   case class Person(fullName: String, age: Int, country: String)\n   ```\n\n4. You keep only:\n\n   * the **current** runtime type\n   * the **structural type** for the old version\n   * a **pure migration** between them\n\nNo old case classes. No old optics. No runtime baggage.\n\nNote there is no requirement that the \"current\" type actually be a real case class, enum, etc.--so you can work purely with structural types, allowing you to define migrations for data types that are never materialized as runtime structures.\n\n---\n\n### Why pure data migrations?\n\nMigrations are represented entirely as **pure data**:\n\n* no user functions\n* no closures\n* no reflection\n* no runtime code generation\n\nAs a result:\n\n* migrations can be **serialized**\n* stored in **registries**\n* applied **dynamically**\n* inspected and transformed\n* used to generate:\n\n  * upgraders\n  * downgraders\n  * SQL DDL / DML\n  * offline data transforms\n\nWhile code generation is **out of scope for this ticket**, this explains many design decisions (invertibility, path-based actions, no functions).\n\n---\n\n## Core Architecture\n\n### Type Hierarchy\n\n```scala\n// Typed migration (user-facing API)\ncase class Migration[A, B](\n  dynamicMigration: DynamicMigration,\n  sourceSchema: Schema[A], // These are structural schemas!!!\n  targetSchema: Schema[B] // These are structural schemas!!!\n) {\n  /** Apply migration to transform A to B */\n  def apply(value: A): Either[MigrationError, B]\n\n  /** Compose migrations sequentially */\n  def ++[C](that: Migration[B, C]): Migration[A, C]\n\n  /** Alias for ++ */\n  def andThen[C](that: Migration[B, C]): Migration[A, C] = this ++ that\n\n  /** Reverse migration (structural inverse; runtime is best-effort) */\n  def reverse: Migration[B, A]\n}\n```\n\n```scala\n// Untyped migration (pure data, fully serializable)\ncase class DynamicMigration(\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) {\n  def apply(value: DynamicValue): Either[MigrationError, DynamicValue]\n  def ++(that: DynamicMigration): DynamicMigration\n  def reverse: DynamicMigration\n}\n```\n\n* `Migration[A, B]` is introspectable, but not pure data due to bindings inside schemas\n* `DynamicMigration` is **fully serializable**\n\n---\n\n## User-Facing API: Selector Expressions\n\n### Selectors, not optics\n\nThe user-facing API **does not expose optics**.\n\nInstead, all locations are specified using **selector expressions**:\n\n```scala\nS => A\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```scala\n_.name\n_.address.street\n_.addresses.each.streetNumber\n_.country.when[UK]\n```\n\nTo see the syntax, one can look at the `optic` macro, which utilizes the same selector syntax for optic creation (e.g. `optic(_.address.street)`, etc.).\n\n### Macro extraction\n\nAll builder methods that accept selectors are **implemented via macros** (or via a macro-generated type class such as `ToDynamicOptic`).\n\nThe macro:\n\n1. Inspects the selector expression\n2. Validates it is a supported projection\n3. Converts it into a `DynamicOptic`\n4. Stores that optic in the migration action\n\nSupported projections include:\n\n* field access (`_.foo.bar`)\n* case selection (`_.country.when[UK]`)\n* collection traversal (`_.items.each`)\n* (future) key access, wrappers, etc.\n\n`DynamicOptic` is **never exposed publicly**.\n\n---\n\n## Migration Builder\n\nAll selector-accepting methods are implemented via macros. For simplicity, these are shown as functions (e.g. `A => Any`), but this is NOT the way to implement them. Either all these functions need to be macros, or a macro needs to be used to generate an implicit / given at each call site. Macros may do additional validation to constrain the validity of these different types of transformations.\n\n```scala\nclass MigrationBuilder[A, B](\n  sourceSchema: Schema[A],\n  targetSchema: Schema[B],\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) {\n\n  // ----- Record operations -----\n\n  def addField(\n    target: B => Any,\n    default: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def dropField(\n    source: A => Any,\n    defaultForReverse: SchemaExpr[B, ?] = SchemaExpr.DefaultValue\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def renameField(\n    from: A => Any,\n    to: B => Any\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformField(\n    from: A => Any,\n    to: B => Any,\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def mandateField(\n    source: A => Option[?],\n    target: B => Any,\n    default: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def optionalizeField(\n    source: A => Any,\n    target: B => Option[?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def changeFieldType(\n    source: A => Any,\n    target: B => Any,\n    converter: SchemaExpr[A, ?]  // primitive-to-primitive only\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Enum operations (limited) -----\n\n  def renameCase[SumA, SumB](\n    from: String,\n    to: String\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformCase[SumA, CaseA, SumB, CaseB](\n    caseMigration: MigrationBuilder[CaseA, CaseB] => MigrationBuilder[CaseA, CaseB]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Collections -----\n\n  def transformElements(\n    at: A => Vector[?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Maps -----\n\n  def transformKeys(\n    at: A => Map[?, ?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformValues(\n    at: A => Map[?, ?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  /** Build migration with full macro validation */\n  def build: Migration[A, B]\n\n  /** Build migration without full validation */\n  def buildPartial: Migration[A, B]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Migration Actions (Untyped Core)\n\nAll actions operate at a **path**, represented by `DynamicOptic`.\n\n```scala\nsealed trait MigrationAction {\n  def at: DynamicOptic\n  def reverse: MigrationAction\n}\n```\n\n### Record Actions\n\n```scala\ncase class AddField(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  default: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class DropField(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  defaultForReverse: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Rename(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  to: String\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformValue(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Mandate(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  default: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Optionalize(\n  at: DynamicOptic\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Join(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  sourcePaths: Vector[DynamicOptic],\n  combiner: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Split(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  targetPaths: Vector[DynamicOptic],\n  splitter: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class ChangeType(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  converter: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n---\n\n### Enum Actions (Supported)\n\n```scala\ncase class RenameCase(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  from: String,\n  to: String\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformCase(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n> Enum case addition / removal is **out of scope** for this ticket\n> (requires composite value construction).\n\n---\n\n### Collection / Map Actions\n\n```scala\ncase class TransformElements(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformKeys(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformValues(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n---\n\n## SchemaExpr Integration\n\n* Used for all value-level transformations\n* **Constraints for this ticket**:\n\n  * primitive → primitive only\n  * joins / splits must produce primitives\n  * no record / enum construction\n\n### `SchemaExpr.DefaultValue`\n\nA special expression that:\n\n1. uses the macro-captured field schema\n2. calls `schema.defaultValue`\n3. converts the value to `DynamicValue`\n4. is stored for reverse migrations\n\n---\n\n## Type Modeling\n\n### Records (Structural Types)\n\n```scala\ntype PersonV0 = { val firstName: String;

def number: String; def exp: String }\ntype OldWireTransfer =\n  { type Tag = \"WireTransfer\"; def account: String; def routing: String }\ntype OldPaymentMethod = OldCreditCard | OldWireTransfer\n```\n\nMacros extract:\n\n* refinement type → structure of the case\n* type `Tag` with singleton type → case tag\n\n---\n\n## Laws\n\n### Identity\n\n```scala\nMigration.identity[A].apply(a) == Right(a)\n```\n\n### Associativity\n\n```scala\n(m1 ++ m2) ++ m3 == m1 ++ (m2 ++ m3)\n```\n\n### Structural Reverse\n\n```scala\nm.reverse.reverse == m\n```\n\n### Best-Effort Semantic Inverse\n\n```scala\nm.apply(a) == Right(b) ⇒ m.reverse.apply(b) == Right(a)\n```\n\n(when sufficient information exists)\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\n* All runtime errors return `MigrationError`\n* Errors must capture **path information** (`DynamicOptic`)\n* Enables diagnostics such as:\n\n> “Failed to apply TransformValue at `.addresses.each.streetNumber`”\n\n---\n\n## Example\n\n```scala\ntype PersonV0 = { val firstName: String; val lastName: String }\n\n@schema\ncase class Person(fullName: String, age: Int)\n\nval migration =\n  Migration.newBuilder[PersonV0, Person]\n    .addField(_.age, 0)\n    .build\n\nval old =\n  new { val firstName = \"John\"; val lastName = \"Doe\" }\n\nmigration(old)\n// Right(Person(\"John Doe\", 0))\n```\n\n---\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n* [ ] `DynamicMigration` fully serializable\n* [ ] `Migration[A, B]` wraps schemas and actions\n* [ ] All actions path-based via `DynamicOptic`\n* [ ] User API uses selector functions (`S => A`) for \"optics\" on old and new types\n* [ ] Macro validation in `.build` to confirm \"old\" has been migrated to \"new\"\n* [ ] `.buildPartial` supported\n* [ ] Structural reverse implemented\n* [ ] Identity & associativity laws hold\n* [ ] Enum rename / transform supported\n* [ ] Errors include path information\n* [ ] Comprehensive tests\n* [ ] Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.5+ supported\n",

No runtime baggage.\n\nNote there is no requirement that the \"current\" type actually be a real case class, enum, etc.--so you can work purely with structural types, allowing you to define migrations for data types that are never materialized as runtime structures.\n\n---\n\n### Why pure data migrations?\n\nMigrations are represented entirely as **pure data**:\n\n* no user functions\n* no closures\n* no reflection\n* no runtime code generation\n\nAs a result:\n\n* migrations can be **serialized**\n* stored in **registries**\n* applied **dynamically**\n* inspected and transformed\n* used to generate:\n\n  * upgraders\n  * downgraders\n  * SQL DDL / DML\n  * offline data transforms\n\nWhile code generation is **out of scope for this ticket**, this explains many design decisions (invertibility, path-based actions, no functions).\n\n---\n\n## Core Architecture\n\n### Type Hierarchy\n\n```scala\n// Typed migration (user-facing API)\ncase class Migration[A, B](\n  dynamicMigration: DynamicMigration,\n  sourceSchema: Schema[A], // These are structural schemas!!!\n  targetSchema: Schema[B] // These are structural schemas!!!\n) {\n  /** Apply migration to transform A to B */\n  def apply(value: A): Either[MigrationError, B]\n\n  /** Compose migrations sequentially */\n  def ++[C](that: Migration[B, C]): Migration[A, C]\n\n  /** Alias for ++ */\n  def andThen[C](that: Migration[B, C]): Migration[A, C] = this ++ that\n\n  /** Reverse migration (structural inverse; runtime is best-effort) */\n  def reverse: Migration[B, A]\n}\n```\n\n```scala\n// Untyped migration (pure data, fully serializable)\ncase class DynamicMigration(\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) {\n  def apply(value: DynamicValue): Either[MigrationError, DynamicValue]\n  def ++(that: DynamicMigration): DynamicMigration\n  def reverse: DynamicMigration\n}\n```\n\n* `Migration[A, B]` is introspectable, but not pure data due to bindings inside schemas\n* `DynamicMigration` is **fully serializable**\n\n---\n\n## User-Facing API: Selector Expressions\n\n### Selectors, not optics\n\nThe user-facing API **does not expose optics**.\n\nInstead, all locations are specified using **selector expressions**:\n\n```scala\nS => A\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```scala\n_.name\n_.address.street\n_.addresses.each.streetNumber\n_.country.when[UK]\n```\n\nTo see the syntax, one can look at the `optic` macro, which utilizes the same selector syntax for optic creation (e.g. `optic(_.address.street)`, etc.).\n\n### Macro extraction\n\nAll builder methods that accept selectors are **implemented via macros** (or via a macro-generated type class such as `ToDynamicOptic`).\n\nThe macro:\n\n1. Inspects the selector expression\n2. Validates it is a supported projection\n3. Converts it into a `DynamicOptic`\n4. Stores that optic in the migration action\n\nSupported projections include:\n\n* field access (`_.foo.bar`)\n* case selection (`_.country.when[UK]`)\n* collection traversal (`_.items.each`)\n* (future) key access, wrappers, etc.\n\n`DynamicOptic` is **never exposed publicly**.\n\n---\n\n## Migration Builder\n\nAll selector-accepting methods are implemented via macros. For simplicity, these are shown as functions (e.g. `A => Any`), but this is NOT the way to implement them. Either all these functions need to be macros, or a macro needs to be used to generate an implicit / given at each call site. Macros may do additional validation to constrain the validity of these different types of transformations.\n\n```scala\nclass MigrationBuilder[A, B](\n  sourceSchema: Schema[A],\n  targetSchema: Schema[B],\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) {\n\n  // ----- Record operations -----\n\n  def addField(\n    target: B => Any,\n    default: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def dropField(\n    source: A => Any,\n    defaultForReverse: SchemaExpr[B, ?] = SchemaExpr.DefaultValue\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def renameField(\n    from: A => Any,\n    to: B => Any\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformField(\n    from: A => Any,\n    to: B => Any,\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def mandateField(\n    source: A => Option[?],\n    target: B => Any,\n    default: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def optionalizeField(\n    source: A => Any,\n    target: B => Option[?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def changeFieldType(\n    source: A => Any,\n    target: B => Any,\n    converter: SchemaExpr[A, ?]  // primitive-to-primitive only\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Enum operations (limited) -----\n\n  def renameCase[SumA, SumB](\n    from: String,\n    to: String\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformCase[SumA, CaseA, SumB, CaseB](\n    caseMigration: MigrationBuilder[CaseA, CaseB] => MigrationBuilder[CaseA, CaseB]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Collections -----\n\n  def transformElements(\n    at: A => Vector[?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Maps -----\n\n  def transformKeys(\n    at: A => Map[?, ?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformValues(\n    at: A => Map[?, ?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  /** Build migration with full macro validation */\n  def build: Migration[A, B]\n\n  /** Build migration without full validation */\n  def buildPartial: Migration[A, B]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Migration Actions (Untyped Core)\n\nAll actions operate at a **path**, represented by `DynamicOptic`.\n\n```scala\nsealed trait MigrationAction {\n  def at: DynamicOptic\n  def reverse: MigrationAction\n}\n```\n\n### Record Actions\n\n```scala\ncase class AddField(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  default: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class DropField(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  defaultForReverse: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Rename(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  to: String\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformValue(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Mandate(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  default: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Optionalize(\n  at: DynamicOptic\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Join(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  sourcePaths: Vector[DynamicOptic],\n  combiner: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Split(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  targetPaths: Vector[DynamicOptic],\n  splitter: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class ChangeType(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  converter: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n---\n\n### Enum Actions (Supported)\n\n```scala\ncase class RenameCase(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  from: String,\n  to: String\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformCase(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n> Enum case addition / removal is **out of scope** for this ticket\n> (requires composite value construction).\n\n---\n\n### Collection / Map Actions\n\n```scala\ncase class TransformElements(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformKeys(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformValues(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n---\n\n## SchemaExpr Integration\n\n* Used for all value-level transformations\n* **Constraints for this ticket**:\n\n  * primitive → primitive only\n  * joins / splits must produce primitives\n  * no record / enum construction\n\n### `SchemaExpr.DefaultValue`\n\nA special expression that:\n\n1. uses the macro-captured field schema\n2. calls `schema.defaultValue`\n3. converts the value to `DynamicValue`\n4. is stored for reverse migrations\n\n---\n\n## Type Modeling\n\n### Records (Structural Types)\n\n```scala\ntype PersonV0 = { val firstName: String; val lastName: String }\ntype PersonV1 = { val fullName: String; val age: Int }\n\nimplicit val v0Schema: Schema[PersonV0] = Schema.structural[PersonV0]\nimplicit val v1Schema: Schema[PersonV1] = Schema.structural[PersonV1]\n```\n\n---\n\n### Enums (Union of Structural Types with Tags)\n\nEnums are encoded into structural types by using union types, together with singleton types (string literals, which represent the name of the case of the enum).\n\nIn structural types, the names of the type aliases shown below are not relevant, nor are they used.\n\n```scala\ntype OldCreditCard =\n  { type Tag = \"CreditCard\"; def number: String; def exp: String }\ntype OldWireTransfer =\n  { type Tag = \"WireTransfer\"; def account: String; def routing: String }\ntype OldPaymentMethod = OldCreditCard | OldWireTransfer\n```\n\nMacros extract:\n\n* refinement type → structure of the case\n* type `Tag` with singleton type → case tag\n\n---\n\n## Laws\n\n### Identity\n\n```scala\nMigration.identity[A].apply(a) == Right(a)\n```\n\n### Associativity\n\n```scala\n(m1 ++ m2) ++ m3 == m1 ++ (m2 ++ m3)\n```\n\n### Structural Reverse\n\n```scala\nm.reverse.reverse == m\n```\n\n### Best-Effort Semantic Inverse\n\n```scala\nm.apply(a) == Right(b) ⇒ m.reverse.apply(b) == Right(a)\n```\n\n(when sufficient information exists)\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\n* All runtime errors return `MigrationError`\n* Errors must capture **path information** (`DynamicOptic`)\n* Enables diagnostics such as:\n\n> “Failed to apply TransformValue at `.addresses.each.streetNumber`”\n\n---\n\n## Example\n\n```scala\ntype PersonV0 = { val firstName: String; val lastName: String }\n\n@schema\ncase class Person(fullName: String, age: Int)\n\nval migration =\n  Migration.newBuilder[PersonV0, Person]\n    .addField(_.age, 0)\n    .build\n\nval old =\n  new { val firstName = \"John\"; val lastName = \"Doe\" }\n\nmigration(old)\n// Right(Person(\"John Doe\", 0))\n```\n\n---\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n* [ ] `DynamicMigration` fully serializable\n* [ ] `Migration[A, B]` wraps schemas and actions\n* [ ] All actions path-based via `DynamicOptic`\n* [ ] User API uses selector functions (`S => A`) for \"optics\" on old and new types\n* [ ] Macro validation in `.build` to confirm \"old\" has been migrated to \"new\"\n* [ ] `.buildPartial` supported\n* [ ] Structural reverse implemented\n* [ ] Identity & associativity laws hold\n* [ ] Enum rename / transform supported\n* [ ] Errors include path information\n* [ ] Comprehensive tests\n* [ ] Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.5+ supported\n",
