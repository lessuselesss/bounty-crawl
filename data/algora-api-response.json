To support any size database we should investigate enhancements to allow any sized database to be exported. Currently the size limitations are 1GB for Durable Objects with 10GB in the future. Operate under the assumption that we might be attempting to dump a 10GB database into a `.sql` file.\n\nAnother consideration to make is because Durable Objects execute synchronous operations we may need to allow for \"breathing intervals\". An example might be we allow our export operation to run for 5 seconds, and take 5 seconds off if other requests are in a queue, then it can pick up again. The goal here would be to prevent locking the database for long periods of time.\n\nBut then poses the questions: \n1. How do we continue operations that need more than 30 seconds to work?\n2. Where is the data stored as it's being created? (R2, S3, something else)?\n3. How do we deliver that dump information to the user after its completed?\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Hit the `/export/dump` endpoint on a large database\n2. Will eventually fail when the 30 second request response time window closes\n\nRun the following command in Terminal (replace the URL with yours) and if your operation exceeds 30 seconds you should see a failed network response instead of a dump file.\n```\ncurl --location 'https://starbasedb.YOUR-ID-HERE.workers.dev/export/dump' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' \\\n--output database_dump.sql\n```\n\nIf you can't create a large enough test database feel free to add code in to `sleep` for 29 seconds before proceeding with the `/export/dump` functional code and should also see the failure.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nAs a user I would expect any and all of the specified data to be dumped out without an error and without partial results. Where it ends up for the user to access if the operation takes more than 30 seconds is up for discussion. Ideally if shorter than 30 seconds it could be returned as our cURL above works today (downloads the file from the response of the origin request), but perhaps after the timeout it continues on uploads it to a destination source to access afterwards?\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n1. For backups require an R2 binding\n2. Have a `.sql` file that gets created in R2 with the filename like `dump_20240101-170000.sql` where it represents `2024-01-01 17:00:00`\n3. Create the file and continuously append new chunks to it until reaching the end\n4. May need to utilize a DO alarm to continue the work after X time if a timeout occurs & mark where it currently is in the process in internal memory so it can pick up and continue.\n5. Provide a callback URL when the operation is finally completed so users can create custom logic to notify them (e.g. Email, Slack, etc)",

The system provides a typed API (`Patch[A]`) built on an untyped core (`DynamicPatch`) that operates on `DynamicValue`.\n\nBelow is a rough outline or sketch of the design of patching & diffing, subject to revision by the implementor based on technical feasibility considerations.\n\n## Core Architecture\n\n### Type Hierarchy\n\n```scala\n// Typed patch (user-facing API)\ncase class Patch[A](dynamicPatch: DynamicPatch, schema: Schema[A]) {\n  /** Apply patch with specified mode */\n  def apply(value: A, mode: PatchMode = PatchMode.Strict): Either[SchemaError, A]\n  \n  /** Compose patches sequentially (monoid operation) */\n  def ++(that: Patch[A]): Patch[A]\n}\n\n// Untyped patch (operates on DynamicValue)\ncase class DynamicPatch(ops: Vector[DynamicPatchOp]) {\n  /** Apply to dynamic value */\n  def apply(value: DynamicValue, mode: PatchMode): Either[SchemaError, DynamicValue]\n  \n  /** Compose patches */\n  def ++(that: DynamicPatch): DynamicPatch\n}\n```\n\n### Operations\n\n```scala\ncase class DynamicPatchOp(optic: DynamicOptic, operation: Operation)\n\nsealed trait Operation\nobject Operation {\n  case class Set(value: DynamicValue) extends Operation\n  case class PrimitiveDelta(op: PrimitiveOp) extends Operation\n  case class SequenceEdit(ops: Vector[SeqOp]) extends Operation\n  case class MapEdit(ops: Vector[MapOp]) extends Operation\n}\n```\n\n## Typed API\n\nAll typed operations live in `Patch` companion object:\n\n```scala\nobject Patch {\n  /** Empty patch (monoid identity) */\n  def empty[A](implicit schema: Schema[A]): Patch[A]\n  \n  /** Set a field/element to a value (clobber semantics) */\n  def set[S, A](optic: Optic[S, A], value: A)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  \n  /** Increment numeric field */\n  def increment[S](optic: Optic[S, Int], delta: Int)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def incrementLong[S](optic: Optic[S, Long], delta: Long)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def incrementDouble[S](optic: Optic[S, Double], delta: Double)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  \n  /** Edit string field */\n  def editString[S](optic: Optic[S, String], edits: Vector[StringOp])(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  \n  /** Sequence operations */\n  def append[S, A](optic: Optic[S, Vector[A]], elements: Vector[A])(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def insertAt[S, A](optic: Optic[S, Vector[A]], index: Int, elements: Vector[A])(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def deleteAt[S, A](optic: Optic[S, Vector[A]], index: Int, count: Int)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  \n  /** Map operations */\n  def addKey[S, K, V](optic: Optic[S, Map[K, V]], key: K, value: V)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def removeKey[S, K, V](optic: Optic[S, Map[K, V]], key: K)(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n  def modifyKey[S, K, V](optic: Optic[S, Map[K, V]], key: K, valuePatch: Patch[V])(implicit schema: Schema[S]): Patch[S]\n}\n```\n\n## Primitive Operations\n\n```scala\nsealed trait PrimitiveOp\nobject PrimitiveOp {\n  // Numeric deltas\n  case class IntDelta(delta: Int) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class LongDelta(delta: Long) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class DoubleDelta(delta: Double) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class FloatDelta(delta: Float) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class ShortDelta(delta: Short) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class ByteDelta(delta: Byte) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class BigIntDelta(delta: BigInt) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class BigDecimalDelta(delta: BigDecimal) extends PrimitiveOp\n  \n  // String edits (LCS-based)\n  case class StringEdit(ops: Vector[StringOp]) extends PrimitiveOp\n  \n  // Temporal deltas\n  case class InstantDelta(duration: java.time.Duration) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class DurationDelta(duration: java.time.Duration) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class LocalDateDelta(period: java.time.Period) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class LocalDateTimeDelta(period: java.time.Period, duration: java.time.Duration) extends PrimitiveOp\n  case class PeriodDelta(period: java.time.Period) extends PrimitiveOp\n  // ... other temporal types\n}\n\nsealed trait StringOp\nobject StringOp {\n  case class Insert(index: Int, text: String) extends StringOp\n  case class Delete(index: Int, length: Int) extends StringOp\n}\n```\n\n## Collection Operations\n\n```scala\nsealed trait SeqOp\nobject SeqOp {\n  /** Insert at index (fails if index occupied in Strict mode) */\n  case class Insert(index: Int, values: Vector[DynamicValue]) extends SeqOp\n  \n  /** Append to end (always succeeds) */\n  case class Append(values: Vector[DynamicValue]) extends SeqOp\n  \n  /** Delete count elements starting at index */\n  case class Delete(index: Int, count: Int) extends SeqOp\n  \n  /** Modify element at index with nested operation */\n  case class Modify(index: Int, op: Operation) extends SeqOp\n}\n\nsealed trait MapOp\nobject MapOp {\n  /** Add key-value (fails if key exists in Strict mode) */\n  case class Add(key: DynamicValue, value: DynamicValue) extends MapOp\n  \n  /** Remove key (fails if key missing in Strict mode) */\n  case class Remove(key: DynamicValue) extends MapOp\n  \n  /** Modify value at key with nested operation */\n  case class Modify(key: DynamicValue, op: Operation) extends MapOp\n}\n```\n\n## Patch Application Modes\n\n```scala\nsealed trait PatchMode\nobject PatchMode {\n  /** Fail on precondition violations (e.g. modifying non-existent key) */\n  case object Strict extends PatchMode\n  \n  /** Skip operations that fail preconditions */\n  case object Lenient extends PatchMode\n  \n  /** Replace/overwrite on conflicts */\n  case object Clobber extends PatchMode\n}\n```\n\n## Schema Integration\n\n```scala\ntrait Schema[A] {\n  /** \n   * Compute smart patch from oldValue to newValue.\n   * Uses heuristics to choose between delta/edit vs set operations.\n   */\n  def diff(oldValue: A, newValue: A): Patch[A]\n  \n  /** Convenience method - apply patch with Strict mode */\n  def patch(value: A, patch: Patch[A]): Either[SchemaError, A] =\n    patch.apply(value, PatchMode.Strict)\n}\n```\n\n## Diffing Strategy\n\nThe `Schema#diff` implementation uses smart heuristics:\n\n1. **New elements/keys**: Use `Operation.Set` \n   - Sequence insertions at new indices\n   - Map additions for new keys\n   - Sum type switches to different cases\n\n2. **String modifications**: Use `StringEdit` if edit sequence is shorter than new string, otherwise use `Set`\n\n3. **Numeric modifications**: Use delta operations (`IntDelta`, etc.)\n\n4. **Structural modifications**: Recursively diff nested structures, using field-level patches for records\n\n5. **Temporal modifications**: Use temporal delta operations for date/time types\n\n## Laws\n\n### Roundtrip Law\nFor all values, the following must hold:\n```scala\n∀ (schema: Schema[A], old: A, new: A).\n  schema.diff(old, new).apply(old) == Right(new)\n```\n\n### Monoid Laws\n```scala\n// Identity (empty patch)\n∀ (p: Patch[A]). \n  p ++ Patch.empty == p\n  Patch.empty ++ p == p\n\n// Associativity\n∀ (p1: Patch[A], p2: Patch[A], p3: Patch[A]).\n  (p1 ++ p2) ++ p3 == p1 ++ (p2 ++ p3)\n```\n\n### Serializability\nAll patch types are pure data (DynamicValue, DynamicOptic, primitives) and must be serializable:\n```scala\n∀ (p: Patch[A]). \n  jsonCodec.decode(jsonCodec.encode(p)) == Right(p)\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- `Operation.Set` uses `DynamicValue` to represent whole values for materialization cases\n- `Patch[A]` converts typed values to `DynamicValue` via `Schema[A]` before applying `DynamicPatch` constructor\n- String edits use LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) algorithm\n- Sequence edits also use LCS for computing minimal insert/delete sequences\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] `DynamicPatch` defined with all operation types, capable of transforming one DynamicValue to another in the most minimal possible way\n- [ ] `Patch[A]` wraps `DynamicPatch` with an additional `Schema[A]`\n- [ ] Typed API in `Patch` companion object for all common operations\n- [ ] `Schema#diff` implements smart diffing strategy\n- [ ] `PatchMode` controls patch application behavior\n- [ ] All fallible operations return `Either[SchemaError, A]` so error information is preserved\n- [ ] Roundtrip law holds for all schema types\n- [ ] Monoid laws hold for patch composition\n- [ ] All patch types serialize/deserialize correctly (except `Patch` itself, which cannot be serialized unless `Schema` is serialized, which in the general case requires a `TypeRegistry`)\n- [ ] String diffs use LCS algorithm\n- [ ] Sequence diffs use LCS algorithm\n- [ ] Comprehensive tests for all operation types, and for serialization of non-`Patch` types such as DynamicPatch and everything it contains\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```scala\n@schema \n@optics\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int, address: Address)\n\n@schema \n@optics\ncase class Address(street: String, city: String, country: String)\n\nval old = Person(\"Alice\", 30, Address(\"123 Main St\", \"NYC\", \"USA\"))\nval new1 = Person(\"Alice\", 31, Address(\"456 Elm St\", \"NYC\", \"USA\"))\n\n// Automatic diffing\nval patch1: Patch[Person] = Person.schema.diff(old, new1)\npatch1(old) // Right(new1)\n\n// Manual patch construction\nval patch2: Patch[Person] = Patch.increment(Person.age, 1) ++ \n             Patch.set(Person.address(Address.street), \"456 Elm St\")\npatch2(old) // Right(new1)\n\n// Patch composition\nval patch3 = patch1 ++ patch2\npatch3(old) // Applies both patches sequentially\n\n// Different application modes\npatch2(old, PatchMode.Strict)   // Fails if preconditions violated\npatch2(old, PatchMode.Lenient)  // Skips failed operations\npatch2(old, PatchMode.Clobber)  // Replaces on conflicts\n\n// Serialization (via @schema on DynamicPatch)\nval json = jsonCodec.encode(patch1.dynamicPatch)\nval recovered = jsonCodec.decode[DynamicPatch](json)\n```",

                  "body": "# Overview\n\nThis ticket involves adding two annotation macros for Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.5+. These annotation macros will add new definitions in the companion object of the trait / class / enum to which they are applied.\n\nThe annotation macros are as follows:\n\n - `@optic`: Adds optics for all terms of the record / enum inside the companion object. Comes in an optional variant, called `@optics_`, which prefixes all optics with an underscore character (`_`) to avoid name collisions. The names of these optics are the same as the term names, except for sum term names, the first letter is lower-cased to avoid colliding with the object of the same name in the same scope.\n - `@schema`: Adds an `implicit` / `given` schema for the record / enum inside the companion object, with the name `<xyz>Schema`, e.g. `personSchema`.\n\n**Note 1**: In the ideal case, applying `@optics` to a sealed trait or enum would result in optics being added to the companion objects of the subtypes of the sealed trait / enum.\n\n## Optics\n### Case Class\n####

              "body": "# Overview\n\nThis ticket involves adding two annotation macros for Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.5+. These annotation macros will add new definitions in the companion object of the trait / class / enum to which they are applied.\n\nThe annotation macros are as follows:\n\n - `@optic`: Adds optics for all terms of the record / enum inside the companion object. Comes in an optional variant, called `@optics_`, which prefixes all optics with an underscore character (`_`) to avoid name collisions. The names of these optics are the same as the term names, except for sum term names, the first letter is lower-cased to avoid colliding with the object of the same name in the same scope.\n - `@schema`: Adds an `implicit` / `given` schema for the record / enum inside the companion object, with the name `<xyz>Schema`, e.g. `personSchema`.\n\n**Note 1**: In the ideal case, applying `@optics` to a sealed trait or enum would result in optics being added to the companion objects of the subtypes of the sealed trait / enum.\n\n## Optics\n### Case Class\n####

Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",
