For example during my [boat project](https://discuss.px4.io/t/rc-speed-boat-with-px4-episode-1-using-px4-to-control-the-boat/28429#things-that-are-still-ambiguous-to-me-22) build, I wasn't sure if I needed to set the priority of magnetometer manually or not.\r\n\r\nThis is also quite related to the calibration pain addressed in the issue #19459. What can we do to improve user experience for setting up the sensors? If so, which part should be addressed and how?\r\n\r\nWhat could be great (in my opinion) could be something like this in QGC (it won't be a literal text output like this, but just for giving some idea):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # First mag sensor\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # One for the second mag\r\n<baro-type> |              | <baro-priority> | <baro-protocol>\r\n<gyro-type> | <gyro-orientation> | <gyro-priority> | <gyro-protocol>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I am also not sure what others expectation / needs are, so any feedback would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n## Describe your preferred solution\r\n* @davids5 pointed out that transferring device tree information over to QGC could be a solution.

For example during my [boat project](https://discuss.px4.io/t/rc-speed-boat-with-px4-episode-1-using-px4-to-control-the-boat/28429#things-that-are-still-ambiguous-to-me-22) build, I wasn't sure if I needed to set the priority of magnetometer manually or not.\r\n\r\nThis is also quite related to the calibration pain addressed in the issue #19459.

              "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWe had a deployment of opal-server that we'd typoed the broadcast URI. We were seeing websockets disconnect errors in the clients, but no errors server side, so no clues it was the broadcast URI. \r\n\r\nAfter turning debug logging on for the server, I spotted the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.018085+0000| fastapi_websocket_rpc.websocket_rpc_e...| INFO  | Client connected\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.018500+0000| websockets.legacy.server                | INFO  | connection open\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.022749+0000| fastapi_websocket_rpc.rpc_channel       |DEBUG  | Handling RPC request - {'request': RpcRequest(method='_ping_', arguments={}, call_id='5d8d421e3dc94751a035b202644c8e8a'), 'channel': '72c2a547ffc64741bd095079bc778d7d'}\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.023420+0000| fastapi_websocket_pubsub.pub_sub_server |DEBUG  | task is done: {<Task finished name='Task-3053' coro=<EventBroadcaster.__read_notifications__() done, defined at /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/fastapi_websocket_pubsub/event_broadcaster.py:245> exception=gaierror(-2, 'Name or service not known')>}\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.023565+0000| fastapi_websocket_pubsub.event_broadc...| INFO  | Cancelling broadcast listen task\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.023677+0000| fastapi_websocket_pubsub.event_broadc...|DEBUG  | Unsubscribing from ALL TOPICS\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.023790+0000| fastapi_websocket_pubsub.event_notifier |DEBUG  | Removing Subscription of topic='__EventNotifier_ALL_TOPICS__' for subscriber=cc43be7c3ebb41e1b4869ace10d213db\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.023948+0000| fastapi_websocket_rpc.websocket_rpc_e...| INFO  | Client connection failed - 42723 :: 72c2a547ffc64741bd095079bc778d7d\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.024165+0000| fastapi_websocket_pubsub.pub_sub_server |DEBUG  | Leaving endpoint's main loop\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.026785+0000| websockets.legacy.server                | INFO  | connection closed\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on the 4th line, I went to look at `fastapi_websocket_pubsub/event_broadcaster.py:245` and saw it was referencing the broadcast URI, at which point I double checked ours and saw the typo. \r\n\r\nWhat I believe to be a bug is that the error is being swallowed, and should probably be elevated to an `ERROR` level log for visibility.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSet the broadcast URI to an invalid value - in our case, a postgres URI with a hostname that didn't resolve.\r\n\r\nLogs: [se616-opal-opal-server-545c454db-hx2nc.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18010731/se616-opal-opal-server-545c454db-hx2nc.log)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA clear error level log to indicate that the broadcast URI could not be resolved\r\n\r\n**OPAL version**\r\n - Version: Client - 0.7.15, Server - 0.7.8\r\n",
