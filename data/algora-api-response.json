To support any size database we should investigate enhancements to allow any sized database to be exported. Currently the size limitations are 1GB for Durable Objects with 10GB in the future. Operate under the assumption that we might be attempting to dump a 10GB database into a `.sql` file.\n\nAnother consideration to make is because Durable Objects execute synchronous operations we may need to allow for \"breathing intervals\". An example might be we allow our export operation to run for 5 seconds, and take 5 seconds off if other requests are in a queue, then it can pick up again. The goal here would be to prevent locking the database for long periods of time.\n\nBut then poses the questions: \n1. How do we continue operations that need more than 30 seconds to work?\n2. Where is the data stored as it's being created? (R2, S3, something else)?\n3. How do we deliver that dump information to the user after its completed?\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Hit the `/export/dump` endpoint on a large database\n2. Will eventually fail when the 30 second request response time window closes\n\nRun the following command in Terminal (replace the URL with yours) and if your operation exceeds 30 seconds you should see a failed network response instead of a dump file.\n```\ncurl --location 'https://starbasedb.YOUR-ID-HERE.workers.dev/export/dump' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' \\\n--output database_dump.sql\n```\n\nIf you can't create a large enough test database feel free to add code in to `sleep` for 29 seconds before proceeding with the `/export/dump` functional code and should also see the failure.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nAs a user I would expect any and all of the specified data to be dumped out without an error and without partial results. Where it ends up for the user to access if the operation takes more than 30 seconds is up for discussion. Ideally if shorter than 30 seconds it could be returned as our cURL above works today (downloads the file from the response of the origin request), but perhaps after the timeout it continues on uploads it to a destination source to access afterwards?\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n1. For backups require an R2 binding\n2. Have a `.sql` file that gets created in R2 with the filename like `dump_20240101-170000.sql` where it represents `2024-01-01 17:00:00`\n3. Create the file and continuously append new chunks to it until reaching the end\n4. May need to utilize a DO alarm to continue the work after X time if a timeout occurs & mark where it currently is in the process in internal memory so it can pick up and continue.\n5. Provide a callback URL when the operation is finally completed so users can create custom logic to notify them (e.g. Email, Slack, etc)",

This leads to a frame drop every time the canvas is snapshotted.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nGo to the Codsandbox full-screen here https://jqgtld.csb.app/ \r\n\r\nLook at the \"Snapshot\" stat in the top right corner (or in the console). On my computer it is ~20ms on Safari 16.5. On Chrome, it is between 0 and 0.3ms.\r\n\r\nThe window size is 1057 x 734 (retina display, so double the dimensions for the canvas)\r\n\r\nHere's the codesandbox with the editor: https://codesandbox.io/s/dazzling-roentgen-jqgtld?file=/src/App.js\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nOverhead for snapshotting to be near 0\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n## Safari\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 23 03 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/1bc6d193-ea1f-4fda-ae03-7ea9c9cf9143)\r\n\r\n## Chrome\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 23 55 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/7a3767f7-94a0-467b-9c23-bac305507d66)\r\n\r\n## iOS\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 27 57 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/664fc6c4-27b8-43ce-be71-b35b7553716f)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 13.4\r\n    CPU: (8) arm64 Apple M1\r\n    Memory: 51.78 MB / 8.00 GB\r\nBrowsers:\r\n    Chrome: 117.0.5938.92\r\n    Safari: 16.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nProvided this also affects Safari 17 (I don't know if it does), this affects _every_ Safari-based browser (including everything on iOS). This performance drop means we had to disable canvas recording for Safari on our app which really limits its usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe larger the canvas, the longer the snapshot time, from what I can tell. Changing `canvasMaxSnapshotDimension` does not appear to make a difference. Safari doesn't even respect the options parameter for `createBitmapImage`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/createImageBitmap\r\n\r\nI'm reasonably confident this comes from the call to `createBitmapImage` here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/highlight/highlight/blob/ed2ea183d0d11781736e2001b01e24e55c33e8cb/frontend/src/__generated/rr/rr.js#L4266-L4269\r\n\r\nIt's supposed to be asynchronous but it looks like it is blocking in Safari. I wonder if there are other ways to get the image data out of a canvas? I understand there are efforts to use WebRTC for canvas recording? I imagine this could help.\r\n",

On Chrome, it is between 0 and 0.3ms.\r\n\r\nThe window size is 1057 x 734 (retina display, so double the dimensions for the canvas)\r\n\r\nHere's the codesandbox with the editor: https://codesandbox.io/s/dazzling-roentgen-jqgtld?file=/src/App.js\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nOverhead for snapshotting to be near 0\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n## Safari\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 23 03 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/1bc6d193-ea1f-4fda-ae03-7ea9c9cf9143)\r\n\r\n## Chrome\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 23 55 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/7a3767f7-94a0-467b-9c23-bac305507d66)\r\n\r\n## iOS\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 27 57 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/664fc6c4-27b8-43ce-be71-b35b7553716f)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 13.4\r\n    CPU: (8) arm64 Apple M1\r\n    Memory: 51.78 MB / 8.00 GB\r\nBrowsers:\r\n    Chrome: 117.0.5938.92\r\n    Safari: 16.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nProvided this also affects Safari 17 (I don't know if it does), this affects _every_ Safari-based browser (including everything on iOS). This performance drop means we had to disable canvas recording for Safari on our app which really limits its usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe larger the canvas, the longer the snapshot time, from what I can tell. Changing `canvasMaxSnapshotDimension` does not appear to make a difference. Safari doesn't even respect the options parameter for `createBitmapImage`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/createImageBitmap\r\n\r\nI'm reasonably confident this comes from the call to `createBitmapImage` here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/highlight/highlight/blob/ed2ea183d0d11781736e2001b01e24e55c33e8cb/frontend/src/__generated/rr/rr.js#L4266-L4269\r\n\r\nIt's supposed to be asynchronous but it looks like it is blocking in Safari. I wonder if there are other ways to get the image data out of a canvas? I understand there are efforts to use WebRTC for canvas recording? I imagine this could help.\r\n",

I’d like to propose adding the SparkFun MicroMod STM32 Processor to the funboards catalog.\n\n- Board: SparkFun MicroMod STM32 Processor (STM32F405RGT6)\n- Product page: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/21326\n- Hardware repo: https://github.com/sparkfun/MicroMod_STM32_Processor\n- Hookup guide: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/micromod-stm32-processor-hookup-guide\n- Schematic (PDF): https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/8/a/a/7/3/MicroMod_STM32_Processor.pdf\n\nWhy this board\n- Expands MicroMod coverage (M.2 “E-class” 22mm edge) and brings STM32F4 (Cortex-M4) into the catalog.\n- Reusable mapping: once the MicroMod edge connector + STM32F405 pins are modeled, other MicroMod processors benefit.\n- Complexity: moderate/advanced (MCU, HSE/LSE clocks, boot/reset gating, SPI flash, SDIO, USB, SWD). Seems like a mid-tier bounty candidate.\n\nDuplication check\n- I checked the public boards list in `tscircuit/sparkfun-boards/boards/` and did not find this board at time of filing.\n- Also glanced at the org project board (https://github.com/orgs/tscircuit/projects/6) and didn’t see it in progress. Please correct me if I missed it.\n\nPlanned implementation (TSX; no XY tooling)\n- Schematic (TSX):\n  - `STM32F405RG` (LQFP-64) with VDDx/VDDA/VSSA, `VCAP1/2` decoupling, `PH0/PH1` 12MHz HSE, `PC14/PC15` 32.768kHz LSE.\n  - SPI flash W25Qxx (WSON-8 6x5) on SPI1 (PA5/PA6/PA7) + `PC4` CS#; HOLD#/WP# as per schematic.\n  - MicroMod edge symbol with named pins: 3.3V, GNDs, `USB_D±`, `USB_VIN`, `RTC_3V`, `3.3V_EN`, `!RESET!`, `!BOOT!`, SWDIO/SWCLK, SDIO, SPI, I2C, UART, BUS/GPIO.\n  - Boot/reset: `BOOT0` gating via P‑MOSFET (DMG2305UX‑7), RC on `NRST`, `PB2` (BOOT1) strapped.\n- PCB (TSX):\n  - 22mm MicroMod card outline with chamfer; custom edge pad footprint (pads 1–75) per MicroMod spec.\n  - Place LQFP‑64, crystals (3225/3215), WSON‑8 flash, decoupling; indicative routing for visuals.\n- Artifacts: snapshots/renders via `tsci snapshot`.\n\nAcceptance/questions\n- Can you confirm it’s green to proceed and eligible for a bounty? If so, please attach a bounty and assign.\n- Any preference for edge connector footprint naming or a canonical MicroMod footprint I should reuse?\n- Any constraints (e.g., minimum visual fidelity for the edge connector, keepout notches, silk expectations)?\n- Any components/modules to avoid for funboards? (I’ve avoided relying on XY import.)\n\nEstimated effort\n- 1–2 days for faithful schematic + functional PCB visualization (including custom edge footprint) and snapshots.\n\nThanks!

The ability to have a UI where we can select networks would also eliminate the connect to predefined network checkbox, as if we select a network when creating or on the Network tab, it will automatically connect to that.\n- [ ] When you select a network when creating a resource, it is automatically connected to the resource without you having to check a checkbox.\n- [ ] Let us remove networks with a click of a button\n- [ ] let us add multiple networks to the container 3-4...\n- [ ] Also enabled Ipv6 on docker networks (all of them should have Ipv4 and Ipv6): https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/discussions/4048\n\n\nGeneral info tab for the current container:\n- [ ] IPv4 and IPv6 IP addresses displayed for the container with a copy button\n- [ ] Mac Adresse is displayed here in the network tab for the container\n- [ ] let us see the container ID \n- [ ] Let us see the container name -> the name with the uuid\n- [ ] Let us set the container name for databases manually if we want\n- [ ] container Image hash \n- [ ] when was the container create\n- [ ] when was it startet -> especially for services\n- [ ] when was the image last pulled\n- [ ] when was the container updated -> depended on this: https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/issues/2500\n",
