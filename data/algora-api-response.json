Is `go-tree-sitter` strictly required for Katana, or only for certain features?  \n2. Are there any alternative pure-Go libraries we could use instead of `go-tree-sitter` to simplify cross-platform builds?  \n\nThis would help in making snapshot builds and CI/CD pipelines simpler, without needing to configure CGO or cross-compilers.  \n\nThanks!\n\n---\n\n### Use Case\n\n- Simplifying cross-platform builds (Windows → macOS/ARM)  \n- Avoiding CGO-related compilation issues  \n- Maintaining full functionality while reducing dependency complexity",

Is `go-tree-sitter` strictly required for Katana, or only for certain features?  \n2. Are there any alternative pure-Go libraries we could use instead of `go-tree-sitter` to simplify cross-platform builds?  \n\nThis would help in making snapshot builds and CI/CD pipelines simpler, without needing to configure CGO or cross-compilers.  \n\nThanks!\n\n---\n\n### Use Case\n\n- Simplifying cross-platform builds (Windows → macOS/ARM)  \n- Avoiding CGO-related compilation issues  \n- Maintaining full functionality while reducing dependency complexity",

The aforementioned line is line 25737 of the output file, so more than 25k targets have been scanned before.\n\n### Anything else:\nThe issue always appears after a long time of execution. Execution of tlsx for the aforementioned approx. 30k targets (aborted/hanging after about 25k targets) started at `2025-04-24T16:50:47+00:00` and the process started hanging at `2025-04-25T10:47:39+0000`, so about 18 hours later.\n\nThe issue does not seem to depend on the specific target host, as tlsx correctly terminates when only scanning the target host.

Hanging happens even while writing JSONL output lines, cutting off a JSONL line somewhere in the middle.\n\n### Expected Behavior:\ntlsx should not hang indefinitely.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce:\ntlsx was started as follows:\n\n```\n~/go/bin/tlsx \\\n\t-list /tmp/host_port_combos.txt \\\n\t-scan-mode 'auto' \\\n\t-ip-version '4' \\\n\t-so \\\n\t-tls-version \\\n\t-cipher \\\n\t-hash 'sha256' \\\n\t-wildcard-cert \\\n\t-probe-status \\\n\t-version-enum \\\n\t-cipher-enum \\\n\t-cipher-type 'all' \\\n\t-serial \\\n\t-expired \\\n\t-self-signed \\\n\t-mismatched \\\n\t-revoked \\\n\t-untrusted \\\n\t-resolvers 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4,1.1.1.1 \\\n\t-certificate \\\n\t-tls-chain \\\n\t-concurrency '300' \\\n\t-cipher-concurrency '10' \\\n\t-timeout '5' \\\n\t-retry '3' \\\n\t-disable-update-check \\\n\t-output /tmp/tlsx_output.jsonl \\\n\t-json \\\n\t-no-color\n```\n\nAt one point, there is no more progress and even output is no longer written. This is the last line of the output file (`/tmp/tlsx_output.jsonl`):\n\n```\n{\"timestamp\":\"2025-04-25T09:59:31.489674682Z\",\"host\":\"xn--<censored>-t6b.<censored>\",\"ip\":\"<censored>\",\"port\":\"443\",\"probe_status\":true,\"tls_version\":\"tls13\",\"cipher\":\"TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\",\"self_signed\":true,\"mismatched\":true,\"not_before\":\"2017-01-16T16:04:01Z\",\"not_after\":\"2027-01-14T16:04:01Z\",\"subject_dn\":\"emailAddress=root@localhost.localdomain, CN=localhost.localdomain, OU=IT, O=MyCompany, L=Seattle, ST=WA, C=US, emailAddress=root@localhost.localdomain\",\"subject_cn\":\n```\nPlease note that the line ends with an open \"subject_cn\" key and the JSON object on that line is never closed. The aforementioned line is line 25737 of the output file, so more than 25k targets have been scanned before.\n\n### Anything else:\nThe issue always appears after a long time of execution. Execution of tlsx for the aforementioned approx. 30k targets (aborted/hanging after about 25k targets) started at `2025-04-24T16:50:47+00:00` and the process started hanging at `2025-04-25T10:47:39+0000`, so about 18 hours later.\n\nThe issue does not seem to depend on the specific target host, as tlsx correctly terminates when only scanning the target host. Also, it always starts hanging indefinitely for a different target, but always after having run for hours and after having already scanned several thousand targets,",
