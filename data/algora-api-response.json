Is `go-tree-sitter` strictly required for Katana, or only for certain features?  \n2. Are there any alternative pure-Go libraries we could use instead of `go-tree-sitter` to simplify cross-platform builds?  \n\nThis would help in making snapshot builds and CI/CD pipelines simpler, without needing to configure CGO or cross-compilers.  \n\nThanks!\n\n---\n\n### Use Case\n\n- Simplifying cross-platform builds (Windows → macOS/ARM)  \n- Avoiding CGO-related compilation issues  \n- Maintaining full functionality while reducing dependency complexity",

Measured in:\n\n  - Text display: X lines/second in main console (can be measured using [stressinator](https://packages.mudlet.org/packages#pkg-Stressinator))\n  - Network: Y MB/s processing throughput (needs to be measured)\n  - Memory: no more than 10% increase in base memory usage\n\n####\n\n",

Measured in:\n\n  - Text display: X lines/second in main console (can be measured using [stressinator](https://packages.mudlet.org/packages#pkg-Stressinator))\n  - Network: Y MB/s processing throughput (needs to be measured)\n  - Memory: no more than 10% increase in base memory usage\n\n####\n\n",
