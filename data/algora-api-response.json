We have many apps (we call them Pieces), that are available within the builder and as MCPs. These apps are built with our TypeScript framework and are easy to develop. Once merged into our repository, they become available as pieces in our automation builder and as MCPs usable by AI agents and MCP clients.\n\nStart building here: [Piece Development Docs](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/developers/building-pieces/overview)\n",

This is kinda visible when you look to not run `yarn -s` but just `yarn`:\r\n```\r\ncodespace ➜ /workspaces/e2e-tests/platforms-serverless/firebase-functions (janpio-patch-5 ✗) $ yarn prisma -v\r\nyarn run v1.22.10\r\nwarning package.json: No license field\r\n$ /workspaces/e2e-tests/node_modules/.bin/prisma -v\r\nprisma               : 2.25.0-dev.36\r\n@prisma/client       : 2.25.0-dev.36\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Suggested solution\r\n\r\nOutput the directory of where the executed `prisma` is from, either similar to Yarn the absolute path to the binary in `node_modules`, or the folder where the `package.json` that is responsible for the installation of Prisma comes from.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n\r\nRely on `yarn` itself to give that information.
