In `parseDockerComposeFile()` for the Application model (around line 2066), add:\n   ```php\n   $isDatabase = isDatabaseImage($image, $service);\n   data_set($service, 'is_database', $isDatabase);\n   ```\n\n2.

Just a filebrowser for everything that you can see inside the container itself. \n\nPrio 1: mapped folders\nPrio 2: everything \"inside\" the container. \n\nIt should support: \n\n- Browsing like windows explorer or nautilus under linux\n- Upload and download single files\n- Upload and download folders\n- Create folders\n- Delete folders / files\n- Check Filesize\n- Check permissions (optional: set them)\n",
