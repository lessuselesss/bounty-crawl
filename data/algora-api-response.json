                  "body": "Hey, I've recently proposed something on Discord, and since feedback has been rather positive, I'm making a ticket to track the idea.\n\nI've been working with Queues recently, and I've been having some issues around `shutdown` that I would like to address.\n\nSpecifically, I find it a common pattern that I send some kind of request object through a queue because I want another fiber to perform some action on my behalf. Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",

Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",

This is making it so I can't use the integration.\r\n\r\nWe also use Fastmail and have been seeing some oddities with the [cal.com](http://cal.com/) integration. Namely, that participants are receiving multiple calendar invites, which on it's own isn't that big of a deal. However, the Fastmail invites are always in UTC, not in the local time of the cal.com invite.\r\n\r\nThis is creating a lot of confusion with participants, they keep missing our meetings, not realizing one invite is UTC and one in local time. I spoke with the Fastmail team and they relayed the following notes about cal's specific integration.\r\n\r\n1. There is a property (SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT) a CalDAV client can add to the event that would prevent CalDAV servers from sending invitations. It appears cal.com is not setting this property even though they are sending an invitation.\r\n2. The invitation being sent by [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is using a different UID. Basically every event has a UID that uniquely identifies the event. Since [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is sending the invitation of the event with a different UID, if you end up adding this event to your calendar [cal.com](http://cal.com/), it will create a duplicate event in your calendar as well. They need to fix it so that all emails associated with a single event use the same original UID.\r\n3. The event added from [cal.com](http://cal.com/) doesn't have a timezone associated with it. Though it mentions the invitees timezone as \"America/Chicago\" in the notes, the event itself doesn't include a timezone and only specifies the time in UTC. Since the event time is specified in UTC, Fastmail's invitation email will also be sent in UTC.\r\n4. There seems to be no way to stop Cal.com from creating the calendar events at all, and thus no real workaround.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Connect to Fastmail using CalDav integration\r\n2. Create a test booking\r\n3. See issues above.\r\n\r\nAny other relevant information. For example, why do you consider this a bug and what did you expect to happen instead?\r\n1. SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT should be set, so Fastmail knows not to send an invitation. **This is the main one.**\r\n2. UID should be unique per event.\r\n3. Event time should have a timezone associated with it.\r\n4. An option could be added to make calendar event creation optional (nice-to-have, not essential).\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\n\r\nNone other than Fastmail/CalDAV.",
