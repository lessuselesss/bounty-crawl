This leads to a frame drop every time the canvas is snapshotted.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nGo to the Codsandbox full-screen here https://jqgtld.csb.app/ \r\n\r\nLook at the \"Snapshot\" stat in the top right corner (or in the console). On my computer it is ~20ms on Safari 16.5. On Chrome, it is between 0 and 0.3ms.\r\n\r\nThe window size is 1057 x 734 (retina display, so double the dimensions for the canvas)\r\n\r\nHere's the codesandbox with the editor: https://codesandbox.io/s/dazzling-roentgen-jqgtld?file=/src/App.js\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nOverhead for snapshotting to be near 0\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n## Safari\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 23 03 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/1bc6d193-ea1f-4fda-ae03-7ea9c9cf9143)\r\n\r\n## Chrome\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 23 55 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/7a3767f7-94a0-467b-9c23-bac305507d66)\r\n\r\n## iOS\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 27 57 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/664fc6c4-27b8-43ce-be71-b35b7553716f)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 13.4\r\n    CPU: (8) arm64 Apple M1\r\n    Memory: 51.78 MB / 8.00 GB\r\nBrowsers:\r\n    Chrome: 117.0.5938.92\r\n    Safari: 16.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nProvided this also affects Safari 17 (I don't know if it does), this affects _every_ Safari-based browser (including everything on iOS). This performance drop means we had to disable canvas recording for Safari on our app which really limits its usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe larger the canvas, the longer the snapshot time, from what I can tell. Changing `canvasMaxSnapshotDimension` does not appear to make a difference. Safari doesn't even respect the options parameter for `createBitmapImage`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/createImageBitmap\r\n\r\nI'm reasonably confident this comes from the call to `createBitmapImage` here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/highlight/highlight/blob/ed2ea183d0d11781736e2001b01e24e55c33e8cb/frontend/src/__generated/rr/rr.js#L4266-L4269\r\n\r\nIt's supposed to be asynchronous but it looks like it is blocking in Safari. I wonder if there are other ways to get the image data out of a canvas? I understand there are efforts to use WebRTC for canvas recording? I imagine this could help.\r\n",

On Chrome, it is between 0 and 0.3ms.\r\n\r\nThe window size is 1057 x 734 (retina display, so double the dimensions for the canvas)\r\n\r\nHere's the codesandbox with the editor: https://codesandbox.io/s/dazzling-roentgen-jqgtld?file=/src/App.js\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nOverhead for snapshotting to be near 0\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n## Safari\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 23 03 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/1bc6d193-ea1f-4fda-ae03-7ea9c9cf9143)\r\n\r\n## Chrome\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 23 55 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/7a3767f7-94a0-467b-9c23-bac305507d66)\r\n\r\n## iOS\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-10-02 at 15 27 57 png](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/assets/3238878/664fc6c4-27b8-43ce-be71-b35b7553716f)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 13.4\r\n    CPU: (8) arm64 Apple M1\r\n    Memory: 51.78 MB / 8.00 GB\r\nBrowsers:\r\n    Chrome: 117.0.5938.92\r\n    Safari: 16.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nProvided this also affects Safari 17 (I don't know if it does), this affects _every_ Safari-based browser (including everything on iOS). This performance drop means we had to disable canvas recording for Safari on our app which really limits its usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe larger the canvas, the longer the snapshot time, from what I can tell. Changing `canvasMaxSnapshotDimension` does not appear to make a difference. Safari doesn't even respect the options parameter for `createBitmapImage`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/createImageBitmap\r\n\r\nI'm reasonably confident this comes from the call to `createBitmapImage` here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/highlight/highlight/blob/ed2ea183d0d11781736e2001b01e24e55c33e8cb/frontend/src/__generated/rr/rr.js#L4266-L4269\r\n\r\nIt's supposed to be asynchronous but it looks like it is blocking in Safari. I wonder if there are other ways to get the image data out of a canvas? I understand there are efforts to use WebRTC for canvas recording? I imagine this could help.\r\n",

Since `go-tree-sitter` relies on CGO, cross-platform compilation (especially for darwin/arm64) becomes complicated.  \n\nI have a few questions:  \n1. Is `go-tree-sitter` strictly required for Katana, or only for certain features?  \n2. Are there any alternative pure-Go libraries we could use instead of `go-tree-sitter` to simplify cross-platform builds?  \n\nThis would help in making snapshot builds and CI/CD pipelines simpler, without needing to configure CGO or cross-compilers.  \n\nThanks!\n\n---\n\n### Use Case\n\n- Simplifying cross-platform builds (Windows → macOS/ARM)  \n- Avoiding CGO-related compilation issues  \n- Maintaining full functionality while reducing dependency complexity",

Since `go-tree-sitter` relies on CGO, cross-platform compilation (especially for darwin/arm64) becomes complicated.  \n\nI have a few questions:  \n1. Is `go-tree-sitter` strictly required for Katana, or only for certain features?  \n2. Are there any alternative pure-Go libraries we could use instead of `go-tree-sitter` to simplify cross-platform builds?  \n\nThis would help in making snapshot builds and CI/CD pipelines simpler, without needing to configure CGO or cross-compilers.  \n\nThanks!\n\n---\n\n### Use Case\n\n- Simplifying cross-platform builds (Windows → macOS/ARM)  \n- Avoiding CGO-related compilation issues  \n- Maintaining full functionality while reducing dependency complexity",

A single `.env` file is created containing ALL environment variables from the entire Docker Compose project\n  2. This `.env` file is automatically added to every container's `env_file:` directive\n\n### Security Implications\n\nThis seems to be a serious security issue. \n\nAny container in a multi-container Docker Compose project can read the secrets/credentials of every other container.\n\nExamples:\n  - In a Next.js + PostgreSQL + Redis stack, the Redis container has access to POSTGRES_PASSWORD and the PostgreSQL container can see OPENAI_API_KEY meant only for the app\n  - In any multi-database setup, each database container can see the credentials of other databases\n  - If one container is compromised, an attacker gains credentials for all containers in the project\n\n###  Expected Behavior\n\n  Each container should only have access to:\n  - Variables explicitly defined in its `environment: ` section\n  - Variables from env files explicitly declared in its `env_file:` section\n  - Coolify metadata variables (`COOLIFY_*`, `SERVICE_URL_*`, etc.) as needed\n\nVariables specific to other containers (especially credentials) should NOT be accessible to unrelated containers.\n\n### Coolify Version\n\nv4.0.0-beta.452\n\n### Are you using Coolify Cloud?\n\nYes (Coolify Cloud)\n",

This `.env` file is automatically added to every container's `env_file:` directive\n\n### Security Implications\n\nThis seems to be a serious security issue. \n\nAny container in a multi-container Docker Compose project can read the secrets/credentials of every other container.\n\nExamples:\n  - In a Next.js + PostgreSQL + Redis stack, the Redis container has access to POSTGRES_PASSWORD and the PostgreSQL container can see OPENAI_API_KEY meant only for the app\n  - In any multi-database setup, each database container can see the credentials of other databases\n  - If one container is compromised, an attacker gains credentials for all containers in the project\n\n###  Expected Behavior\n\n  Each container should only have access to:\n  - Variables explicitly defined in its `environment: ` section\n  - Variables from env files explicitly declared in its `env_file:` section\n  - Coolify metadata variables (`COOLIFY_*`, `SERVICE_URL_*`, etc.) as needed\n\nVariables specific to other containers (especially credentials) should NOT be accessible to unrelated containers.\n\n### Coolify Version\n\nv4.0.0-beta.452\n\n### Are you using Coolify Cloud?\n\nYes (Coolify Cloud)\n",
