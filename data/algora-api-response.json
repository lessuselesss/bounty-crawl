Instead, I want to invite them to a specific project on Coolify and for them to only have access to that project.\n\nAdditionally, I want to optionally allow the project-specific member to deploy their own apps on the servers on the account. This will just create a new project in the Team with them as a project-specific member.\n\nI should be able to manage all project-specific members from the main team page in addition to on each project’s page.\n\nAny APIs that exist for managing team members should also work for project-specific members.\n\nThe purpose of this bounty is to create a secure way to give people limited access to projects on Coolify. They must not be able to break out of their permissions. For example, if I can SSH into a server as a project member using one of the keys - that would allow me to break out of my permissions.\n\nAcceptance criteria: Once your PR is merged and deployed on Coolify Cloud, I will test the features and award the bounty. Thanks!\n\n[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) previously awarded bounties to implement database SSL and APIs to manage backups. We’re a nonprofit for teenage coders!",

              "body": "### Request Type\n\nNew Feature\n\n### Description\n\n$1,000 USD bounty.\n\nAdd support for project-specific team members.\n\nProblem: I have team members I want to add to a project on Coolify, but I don’t want to give them access to the full account and to all projects on the server. Instead, I want to invite them to a specific project on Coolify and for them to only have access to that project.\n\nAdditionally, I want to optionally allow the project-specific member to deploy their own apps on the servers on the account. This will just create a new project in the Team with them as a project-specific member.\n\nI should be able to manage all project-specific members from the main team page in addition to on each project’s page.\n\nAny APIs that exist for managing team members should also work for project-specific members.\n\nThe purpose of this bounty is to create a secure way to give people limited access to projects on Coolify. They must not be able to break out of their permissions. For example, if I can SSH into a server as a project member using one of the keys - that would allow me to break out of my permissions.\n\nAcceptance criteria: Once your PR is merged and deployed on Coolify Cloud, I will test the features and award the bounty. Thanks!\n\n[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) previously awarded bounties to implement database SSL and APIs to manage backups. We’re a nonprofit for teenage coders!",

To support any size database we should investigate enhancements to allow any sized database to be exported. Currently the size limitations are 1GB for Durable Objects with 10GB in the future. Operate under the assumption that we might be attempting to dump a 10GB database into a `.sql` file.\n\nAnother consideration to make is because Durable Objects execute synchronous operations we may need to allow for \"breathing intervals\". An example might be we allow our export operation to run for 5 seconds, and take 5 seconds off if other requests are in a queue, then it can pick up again. The goal here would be to prevent locking the database for long periods of time.\n\nBut then poses the questions: \n1. How do we continue operations that need more than 30 seconds to work?\n2. Where is the data stored as it's being created? (R2, S3, something else)?\n3. How do we deliver that dump information to the user after its completed?\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Hit the `/export/dump` endpoint on a large database\n2. Will eventually fail when the 30 second request response time window closes\n\nRun the following command in Terminal (replace the URL with yours) and if your operation exceeds 30 seconds you should see a failed network response instead of a dump file.\n```\ncurl --location 'https://starbasedb.YOUR-ID-HERE.workers.dev/export/dump' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' \\\n--output database_dump.sql\n```\n\nIf you can't create a large enough test database feel free to add code in to `sleep` for 29 seconds before proceeding with the `/export/dump` functional code and should also see the failure.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nAs a user I would expect any and all of the specified data to be dumped out without an error and without partial results. Where it ends up for the user to access if the operation takes more than 30 seconds is up for discussion. Ideally if shorter than 30 seconds it could be returned as our cURL above works today (downloads the file from the response of the origin request), but perhaps after the timeout it continues on uploads it to a destination source to access afterwards?\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n1. For backups require an R2 binding\n2. Have a `.sql` file that gets created in R2 with the filename like `dump_20240101-170000.sql` where it represents `2024-01-01 17:00:00`\n3. Create the file and continuously append new chunks to it until reaching the end\n4. May need to utilize a DO alarm to continue the work after X time if a timeout occurs & mark where it currently is in the process in internal memory so it can pick up and continue.\n5.

Please describe.**\nStarbaseDB instances support by default an internal database (SQLite offered by the Durable Object) as well as an optional external data source. External data sources can be powered in one of two ways, both by providing values in the `wrangler.toml` file of the project.\n\n- Outerbase API Key\n- Connection details of the database\n\n<img width=\"481\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/485d4b88-a7f8-432d-9f29-d3239a6e6577\" />\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nWhat would be beneficial for some use cases is the ability to bring in an external data source (e.g. a Postgres on Supabase) and have a pull mechanism where data can be brought into the internal DO SQLite so that the instance serves as a close-to-edge replica that can be queried alternatively to querying the Supabase Postgres instance.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n- Considering the pull vs push mechanism. A pull mechanism seems to be a better global solution where a push mechanism would be required to live elsewhere on a per provider basis.\n\n**Additional context**\n- Might be beneficial for users to be able to define in the plugin what intervals data should be pulled at\n- Might be beneficial to allow users to define which tables should have data pulled into it (perhaps not all tables need replicated)\n- Likely need a way to know for each table what the last queried items were so you can do append-only type polling for new data. Does a user need to define a column to base this on (e.g. `id` or `created_at` columns perhaps)?\n",

              "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\nStarbaseDB instances support by default an internal database (SQLite offered by the Durable Object) as well as an optional external data source. External data sources can be powered in one of two ways, both by providing values in the `wrangler.toml` file of the project.\n\n- Outerbase API Key\n- Connection details of the database\n\n<img width=\"481\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/485d4b88-a7f8-432d-9f29-d3239a6e6577\" />\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nWhat would be beneficial for some use cases is the ability to bring in an external data source (e.g. a Postgres on Supabase) and have a pull mechanism where data can be brought into the internal DO SQLite so that the instance serves as a close-to-edge replica that can be queried alternatively to querying the Supabase Postgres instance.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n- Considering the pull vs push mechanism. A pull mechanism seems to be a better global solution where a push mechanism would be required to live elsewhere on a per provider basis.\n\n**Additional context**\n- Might be beneficial for users to be able to define in the plugin what intervals data should be pulled at\n- Might be beneficial to allow users to define which tables should have data pulled into it (perhaps not all tables need replicated)\n- Likely need a way to know for each table what the last queried items were so you can do append-only type polling for new data. Does a user need to define a column to base this on (e.g. `id` or `created_at` columns perhaps)?\n",
