For example during my [boat project](https://discuss.px4.io/t/rc-speed-boat-with-px4-episode-1-using-px4-to-control-the-boat/28429#things-that-are-still-ambiguous-to-me-22) build, I wasn't sure if I needed to set the priority of magnetometer manually or not.\r\n\r\nThis is also quite related to the calibration pain addressed in the issue #19459. What can we do to improve user experience for setting up the sensors? If so, which part should be addressed and how?\r\n\r\nWhat could be great (in my opinion) could be something like this in QGC (it won't be a literal text output like this, but just for giving some idea):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # First mag sensor\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # One for the second mag\r\n<baro-type> |              | <baro-priority> | <baro-protocol>\r\n<gyro-type> | <gyro-orientation> | <gyro-priority> | <gyro-protocol>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I am also not sure what others expectation / needs are, so any feedback would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n## Describe your preferred solution\r\n* @davids5 pointed out that transferring device tree information over to QGC could be a solution. Could you elaborate on that?\r\n* @dagar pointed out that having a unified view in general would be good. Could you let me know if a view I suggested above is similar to what you have imagined?\r\n",

              "body": "## Describe problem solved by the proposed feature\r\nCurrently it is hard to figure out which sensors are connected where, with which configuration and which priority (e.g. `CAL_MAG0_PRIO`) in a single view. For example during my [boat project](https://discuss.px4.io/t/rc-speed-boat-with-px4-episode-1-using-px4-to-control-the-boat/28429#things-that-are-still-ambiguous-to-me-22) build, I wasn't sure if I needed to set the priority of magnetometer manually or not.\r\n\r\nThis is also quite related to the calibration pain addressed in the issue #19459. What can we do to improve user experience for setting up the sensors? If so, which part should be addressed and how?\r\n\r\nWhat could be great (in my opinion) could be something like this in QGC (it won't be a literal text output like this, but just for giving some idea):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # First mag sensor\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # One for the second mag\r\n<baro-type> |              | <baro-priority> | <baro-protocol>\r\n<gyro-type> | <gyro-orientation> | <gyro-priority> | <gyro-protocol>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I am also not sure what others expectation / needs are, so any feedback would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n## Describe your preferred solution\r\n* @davids5 pointed out that transferring device tree information over to QGC could be a solution. Could you elaborate on that?\r\n* @dagar pointed out that having a unified view in general would be good. Could you let me know if a view I suggested above is similar to what you have imagined?\r\n",

              "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWe had a deployment of opal-server that we'd typoed the broadcast URI. We were seeing websockets disconnect errors in the clients, but no errors server side, so no clues it was the broadcast URI. \r\n\r\nAfter turning debug logging on for the server, I spotted the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.018085+0000| fastapi_websocket_rpc.websocket_rpc_e...| INFO  | Client connected\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.018500+0000| websockets.legacy.server                | INFO  | connection open\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.022749+0000| fastapi_websocket_rpc.rpc_channel       |DEBUG  | Handling RPC request - {'request': RpcRequest(method='_ping_', arguments={}, call_id='5d8d421e3dc94751a035b202644c8e8a'), 'channel': '72c2a547ffc64741bd095079bc778d7d'}\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.023420+0000| fastapi_websocket_pubsub.pub_sub_server |DEBUG  | task is done: {<Task finished name='Task-3053' coro=<EventBroadcaster.__read_notifications__() done, defined at /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/fastapi_websocket_pubsub/event_broadcaster.py:245> exception=gaierror(-2, 'Name or service not known')>}\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.023565+0000| fastapi_websocket_pubsub.event_broadc...| INFO  | Cancelling broadcast listen task\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.023677+0000| fastapi_websocket_pubsub.event_broadc...|DEBUG  | Unsubscribing from ALL TOPICS\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.023790+0000| fastapi_websocket_pubsub.event_notifier |DEBUG  | Removing Subscription of topic='__EventNotifier_ALL_TOPICS__' for subscriber=cc43be7c3ebb41e1b4869ace10d213db\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.023948+0000| fastapi_websocket_rpc.websocket_rpc_e...| INFO  | Client connection failed - 42723 :: 72c2a547ffc64741bd095079bc778d7d\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.024165+0000| fastapi_websocket_pubsub.pub_sub_server |DEBUG  | Leaving endpoint's main loop\r\n2024-12-04T15:27:01.026785+0000| websockets.legacy.server                | INFO  | connection closed\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on the 4th line, I went to look at `fastapi_websocket_pubsub/event_broadcaster.py:245` and saw it was referencing the broadcast URI, at which point I double checked ours and saw the typo. \r\n\r\nWhat I believe to be a bug is that the error is being swallowed, and should probably be elevated to an `ERROR` level log for visibility.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSet the broadcast URI to an invalid value - in our case, a postgres URI with a hostname that didn't resolve.\r\n\r\nLogs: [se616-opal-opal-server-545c454db-hx2nc.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18010731/se616-opal-opal-server-545c454db-hx2nc.log)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA clear error level log to indicate that the broadcast URI could not be resolved\r\n\r\n**OPAL version**\r\n - Version: Client - 0.7.15, Server - 0.7.8\r\n",

Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",
