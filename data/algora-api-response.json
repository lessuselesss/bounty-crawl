This `.env` file is automatically added to every container's `env_file:` directive\n\n### Security Implications\n\nThis seems to be a serious security issue. \n\nAny container in a multi-container Docker Compose project can read the secrets/credentials of every other container.\n\nExamples:\n  - In a Next.js + PostgreSQL + Redis stack, the Redis container has access to POSTGRES_PASSWORD and the PostgreSQL container can see OPENAI_API_KEY meant only for the app\n  - In any multi-database setup, each database container can see the credentials of other databases\n  - If one container is compromised, an attacker gains credentials for all containers in the project\n\n###  Expected Behavior\n\n  Each container should only have access to:\n  - Variables explicitly defined in its `environment: ` section\n  - Variables from env files explicitly declared in its `env_file:` section\n  - Coolify metadata variables (`COOLIFY_*`, `SERVICE_URL_*`, etc.) as needed\n\nVariables specific to other containers (especially credentials) should NOT be accessible to unrelated containers.\n\n### Coolify Version\n\nv4.0.0-beta.452\n\n### Are you using Coolify Cloud?\n\nYes (Coolify Cloud)\n",
