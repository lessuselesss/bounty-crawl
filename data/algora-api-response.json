This type should mirror the existing <code>DynamicPatch</code> implementation, adapted for JSON's simpler data model.</p>\n<h2>Motivation</h2>\n<p><code>DynamicValue</code> has a well-designed <code>DynamicPatch</code> system with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monoid composition (<code>++</code> with <code>empty</code> identity)</li>\n<li>LCS-based sequence diffing</li>\n<li>Primitive delta operations (numeric deltas, string edits)</li>\n<li>Comprehensive algebraic laws verified by property tests</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposed <code>Json</code> type (see #TBD) needs equivalent patching capabilities. Rather than converting <code>Json ↔ DynamicValue</code> for every patch operation, a native <code>JsonPatch</code> provides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Type safety (no conversion errors for JSON-incompatible DynamicPatch operations)</li>\n<li>API consistency with the <code>Json</code> type</li>\n<li>Potential for JSON-specific optimizations</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Design Sketch</h2>\n<p>A design sketch is available at <a href=\"https://claude.ai/chat/schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala\"><code>schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala</code></a>. This sketch is <strong>a guide, not a specification</strong> — implementers should use judgment and deviate where appropriate.</p>\n<h3>Core Types</h3>\n<p>The design mirrors <code>DynamicPatch</code> with JSON-specific adaptations:</p>\n\nDynamicPatch | JsonPatch | Notes\n-- | -- | --\nDynamicPatch(Vector[DynamicPatchOp]) | JsonPatch(Vector[JsonPatchOp]) | Same structure\nOperation.Set | Op.Set | Same\nOperation.PrimitiveDelta | Op.PrimitiveDelta | Simplified for JSON types\nOperation.SequenceEdit | Op.ArrayEdit | Renamed\nOperation.MapEdit | Op.ObjectEdit | String keys only\nOperation.Patch | Op.Nested | Same\nSeqOp | ArrayOp | Same operations\nMapOp | ObjectOp | String keys only\nPrimitiveOp (14 variants) | PrimitiveOp (2 variants) | See below\n\n\n<h3>StringOp</h3>\n<p>Mirror <code>DynamicPatch.StringOp</code> exactly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Insert(index: Int, text: String)</code></li>\n<li><code>Delete(index: Int, length: Int)</code></li>\n<li><code>Append(text: String)</code></li>\n<li><code>Modify(index: Int, length: Int, text: String)</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>ArrayOp</h3>\n<p>Mirror <code>DynamicPatch.SeqOp</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Insert(index: Int, values: Vector[Json])</code></li>\n<li><code>Append(values: Vector[Json])</code></li>\n<li><code>Delete(index: Int, count: Int)</code></li>\n<li><code>Modify(index: Int, op: Op)</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>ObjectOp</h3>\n<p>Mirror <code>DynamicPatch.MapOp</code> with string keys:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Add(key: String, value: Json)</code></li>\n<li><code>Remove(key: String)</code></li>\n<li><code>Modify(key: String, patch: JsonPatch)</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\n<h3>Functional Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>[ ] <strong>F1</strong>: <code>JsonPatch.diff(source, target)</code> computes a patch transforming source to target</li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>F2</strong>: <code>patch.apply(json, mode)</code> applies a patch with configurable failure handling</li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>F3</strong>: <code>patch1 ++ patch2</code> composes patches (apply first, then second)</li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>F4</strong>: <code>JsonPatch.empty</code> is the identity element for composition</li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>F5</strong>: Support <code>JsonPatchMode.Strict</code>, <code>Lenient</code>, and <code>Clobber</code> modes</li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>F6</strong>: Bidirectional conversion: <code>toDynamicPatch</code> / <code>fromDynamicPatch</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Algebraic Laws</h3>\n<p>All laws must be verified with property-based tests (see <code>PatchLawsSpec</code> for reference):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[ ] <strong>L1</strong>: Left identity — <code>(empty ++ p)(j) == p(j)</code></li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>L2</strong>: Right identity — <code>(p ++ empty)(j) == p(j)</code></li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>L3</strong>: Associativity — <code>((p1 ++ p2) ++ p3)(j) == (p1 ++ (p2 ++ p3))(j)</code></li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>L4</strong>: Roundtrip — <code>diff(a, b)(a) == Right(b)</code></li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>L5</strong>: Identity diff — <code>diff(j, j).isEmpty</code></li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>L6</strong>: Diff composition — <code>(diff(a, b) ++ diff(b, c))(a) == Right(c)</code></li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>L7</strong>: Lenient subsumes Strict — if <code>p(j, Strict) == Right(r)</code> then <code>p(j, Lenient) == Right(r)</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Testing Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>[ ] <strong>T1</strong>: Property-based tests for all algebraic laws (see <code>PatchLawsSpec</code>)</li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>T2</strong>: Test each operation type (<code>Set</code>, <code>PrimitiveDelta</code>, <code>ArrayEdit</code>, <code>ObjectEdit</code>, <code>Nested</code>)</li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>T3</strong>: Test each <code>ArrayOp</code> variant (<code>Insert</code>, <code>Append</code>, <code>Delete</code>, <code>Modify</code>)</li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>T4</strong>: Test each <code>ObjectOp</code> variant (<code>Add</code>, <code>Remove</code>, <code>Modify</code>)</li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>T5</strong>: Test each <code>StringOp</code> variant (<code>Insert</code>, <code>Delete</code>, <code>Append</code>, <code>Modify</code>)</li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>T6</strong>: Test <code>NumberDelta</code> with positive, negative, zero, and decimal deltas</li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>T7</strong>: Test all three <code>JsonPatchMode</code> behaviors</li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>T8</strong>: Test <code>toDynamicPatch</code> / <code>fromDynamicPatch</code> roundtrip</li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>T9</strong>: Test edge cases: empty arrays, empty objects, empty strings, nested structures</li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>T10</strong>: Test error cases: invalid paths, type mismatches, out-of-bounds indices</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Documentation Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>[ ] <strong>D1</strong>: ScalaDoc for all public types and methods</li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>D2</strong>: Usage examples in ScalaDoc (see sketch for examples)</li>\n<li>[ ] <strong>D3</strong>: Document

This type should mirror the existing `DynamicPatch` implementation, adapted for JSON's simpler data model.\n\n## Motivation\n\n`DynamicValue` has a well-designed `DynamicPatch` system with:\n- Monoid composition (`++` with `empty` identity)\n- LCS-based sequence diffing\n- Primitive delta operations (numeric deltas, string edits)\n- Comprehensive algebraic laws verified by property tests\n\nThe proposed `Json` type (see #TBD) needs equivalent patching capabilities. Rather than converting `Json ↔ DynamicValue` for every patch operation, a native `JsonPatch` provides:\n- Type safety (no conversion errors for JSON-incompatible DynamicPatch operations)\n- API consistency with the `Json` type\n- Potential for JSON-specific optimizations\n\n## Design Sketch\n\nA design sketch is available at [`[schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala](https://claude.ai/chat/schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala)`](./schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala). This sketch is **a guide, not a specification** — implementers should use judgment and deviate where appropriate.\n\n### Core Types\n\nThe design mirrors `DynamicPatch` with JSON-specific adaptations:\n\n| DynamicPatch | JsonPatch | Notes |\n|--------------|-----------|-------|\n| `DynamicPatch(Vector[DynamicPatchOp])` | `JsonPatch(Vector[JsonPatchOp])` | Same structure |\n| `Operation.Set` | `Op.Set` | Same |\n| `Operation.PrimitiveDelta` | `Op.PrimitiveDelta` | Simplified for JSON types |\n| `Operation.SequenceEdit` | `Op.ArrayEdit` | Renamed |\n| `Operation.MapEdit` | `Op.ObjectEdit` | String keys only |\n| `Operation.Patch` | `Op.Nested` | Same |\n| `SeqOp` | `ArrayOp` | Same operations |\n| `MapOp` | `ObjectOp` | String keys only |\n| `PrimitiveOp` (14 variants) | `PrimitiveOp` (2 variants) | See below |\n\n### Primitive Operations\n\nJSON has a simpler type system than `DynamicValue`:\n\n| JSON Type | Delta Operation | Notes |\n|-----------|-----------------|-------|\n| Number | `NumberDelta(BigDecimal)` | Unifies all numeric deltas |\n| String | `StringEdit(Vector[StringOp])` | Same as `DynamicPatch` |\n| Boolean | Use `Op.Set` | No delta (same as `DynamicPatch`) |\n| Null | Use `Op.Set` | No delta |\n\n### StringOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.StringOp` exactly:\n- `Insert(index: Int, text: String)`\n- `Delete(index: Int, length: Int)`\n- `Append(text: String)`\n- `Modify(index: Int, length: Int, text: String)`\n\n### ArrayOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.SeqOp`:\n- `Insert(index: Int, values: Vector[Json])`\n- `Append(values: Vector[Json])`\n- `Delete(index: Int, count: Int)`\n- `Modify(index: Int, op: Op)`\n\n### ObjectOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.MapOp` with string keys:\n- `Add(key: String, value: Json)`\n- `Remove(key: String)`\n- `Modify(key: String, patch: JsonPatch)`\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- [ ] **F1**: `JsonPatch.diff(source, target)` computes a patch transforming source to target\n- [ ] **F2**: `patch.apply(json, mode)` applies a patch with configurable failure handling\n- [ ] **F3**: `patch1 ++ patch2` composes patches (apply first, then second)\n- [ ] **F4**: `JsonPatch.empty` is the identity element for composition\n- [ ] **F5**: Support `JsonPatchMode.Strict`, `Lenient`, and `Clobber` modes\n- [ ] **F6**: Bidirectional conversion: `toDynamicPatch` / `fromDynamicPatch`\n\n### Algebraic Laws\n\nAll laws must be verified with property-based tests (see `PatchLawsSpec` for reference):\n\n- [ ] **L1**: Left identity — `(empty ++ p)(j) == p(j)`\n- [ ] **L2**: Right identity — `(p ++ empty)(j) == p(j)`\n- [ ] **L3**: Associativity — `((p1 ++ p2) ++ p3)(j) == (p1 ++ (p2 ++ p3))(j)`\n- [ ] **L4**: Roundtrip — `diff(a, b)(a) == Right(b)`\n- [ ] **L5**: Identity diff — `diff(j, j).isEmpty`\n- [ ] **L6**: Diff composition — `(diff(a, b) ++ diff(b, c))(a) == Right(c)`\n- [ ] **L7**: Lenient subsumes Strict — if `p(j, Strict) == Right(r)` then `p(j, Lenient) == Right(r)`\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- [ ] **T1**: Property-based tests for all algebraic laws (see `PatchLawsSpec`)\n- [ ] **T2**: Test each operation type (`Set`, `PrimitiveDelta`, `ArrayEdit`, `ObjectEdit`, `Nested`)\n- [ ] **T3**: Test each `ArrayOp` variant (`Insert`, `Append`, `Delete`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T4**: Test each `ObjectOp` variant (`Add`, `Remove`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T5**: Test each `StringOp` variant (`Insert`, `Delete`, `Append`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T6**: Test `NumberDelta` with positive, negative, zero, and decimal deltas\n- [ ] **T7**: Test all three `JsonPatchMode` behaviors\n- [ ] **T8**: Test `toDynamicPatch` / `fromDynamicPatch` roundtrip\n- [ ] **T9**: Test edge cases: empty arrays, empty objects, empty strings, nested structures\n- [ ] **T10**: Test error cases: invalid paths, type mismatches, out-of-bounds indices\n\n### Documentation Requirements\n\n- [ ] **D1**: ScalaDoc for all public types and methods\n- [ ] **D2**: Usage examples in ScalaDoc (see sketch for examples)\n- [ ] **D3**: Document algebraic laws in type-level comments\n- [ ] **D4**: Document relationship to `DynamicPatch`\n\n## Related\n\n-

This type should mirror the existing `DynamicPatch` implementation, adapted for JSON's simpler data model.\n\n## Motivation\n\n`DynamicValue` has a well-designed `DynamicPatch` system with:\n- Monoid composition (`++` with `empty` identity)\n- LCS-based sequence diffing\n- Primitive delta operations (numeric deltas, string edits)\n- Comprehensive algebraic laws verified by property tests\n\nThe proposed `Json` type (see #TBD) needs equivalent patching capabilities. Rather than converting `Json ↔ DynamicValue` for every patch operation, a native `JsonPatch` provides:\n- Type safety (no conversion errors for JSON-incompatible DynamicPatch operations)\n- API consistency with the `Json` type\n- Potential for JSON-specific optimizations\n\n## Design Sketch\n\nA design sketch is available at [`[schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala](https://claude.ai/chat/schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala)`](./schema/shared/src/main/scala/zio/blocks/schema/json/JsonPatch.scala). This sketch is **a guide, not a specification** — implementers should use judgment and deviate where appropriate.\n\n### Core Types\n\nThe design mirrors `DynamicPatch` with JSON-specific adaptations:\n\n| DynamicPatch | JsonPatch | Notes |\n|--------------|-----------|-------|\n| `DynamicPatch(Vector[DynamicPatchOp])` | `JsonPatch(Vector[JsonPatchOp])` | Same structure |\n| `Operation.Set` | `Op.Set` | Same |\n| `Operation.PrimitiveDelta` | `Op.PrimitiveDelta` | Simplified for JSON types |\n| `Operation.SequenceEdit` | `Op.ArrayEdit` | Renamed |\n| `Operation.MapEdit` | `Op.ObjectEdit` | String keys only |\n| `Operation.Patch` | `Op.Nested` | Same |\n| `SeqOp` | `ArrayOp` | Same operations |\n| `MapOp` | `ObjectOp` | String keys only |\n| `PrimitiveOp` (14 variants) | `PrimitiveOp` (2 variants) | See below |\n\n### Primitive Operations\n\nJSON has a simpler type system than `DynamicValue`:\n\n| JSON Type | Delta Operation | Notes |\n|-----------|-----------------|-------|\n| Number | `NumberDelta(BigDecimal)` | Unifies all numeric deltas |\n| String | `StringEdit(Vector[StringOp])` | Same as `DynamicPatch` |\n| Boolean | Use `Op.Set` | No delta (same as `DynamicPatch`) |\n| Null | Use `Op.Set` | No delta |\n\n### StringOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.StringOp` exactly:\n- `Insert(index: Int, text: String)`\n- `Delete(index: Int, length: Int)`\n- `Append(text: String)`\n- `Modify(index: Int, length: Int, text: String)`\n\n### ArrayOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.SeqOp`:\n- `Insert(index: Int, values: Vector[Json])`\n- `Append(values: Vector[Json])`\n- `Delete(index: Int, count: Int)`\n- `Modify(index: Int, op: Op)`\n\n### ObjectOp\n\nMirror `DynamicPatch.MapOp` with string keys:\n- `Add(key: String, value: Json)`\n- `Remove(key: String)`\n- `Modify(key: String, patch: JsonPatch)`\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- [ ] **F1**: `JsonPatch.diff(source, target)` computes a patch transforming source to target\n- [ ] **F2**: `patch.apply(json, mode)` applies a patch with configurable failure handling\n- [ ] **F3**: `patch1 ++ patch2` composes patches (apply first, then second)\n- [ ] **F4**: `JsonPatch.empty` is the identity element for composition\n- [ ] **F5**: Support `JsonPatchMode.Strict`, `Lenient`, and `Clobber` modes\n- [ ] **F6**: Bidirectional conversion: `toDynamicPatch` / `fromDynamicPatch`\n\n### Algebraic Laws\n\nAll laws must be verified with property-based tests (see `PatchLawsSpec` for reference):\n\n- [ ] **L1**: Left identity — `(empty ++ p)(j) == p(j)`\n- [ ] **L2**: Right identity — `(p ++ empty)(j) == p(j)`\n- [ ] **L3**: Associativity — `((p1 ++ p2) ++ p3)(j) == (p1 ++ (p2 ++ p3))(j)`\n- [ ] **L4**: Roundtrip — `diff(a, b)(a) == Right(b)`\n- [ ] **L5**: Identity diff — `diff(j, j).isEmpty`\n- [ ] **L6**: Diff composition — `(diff(a, b) ++ diff(b, c))(a) == Right(c)`\n- [ ] **L7**: Lenient subsumes Strict — if `p(j, Strict) == Right(r)` then `p(j, Lenient) == Right(r)`\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- [ ] **T1**: Property-based tests for all algebraic laws (see `PatchLawsSpec`)\n- [ ] **T2**: Test each operation type (`Set`, `PrimitiveDelta`, `ArrayEdit`, `ObjectEdit`, `Nested`)\n- [ ] **T3**: Test each `ArrayOp` variant (`Insert`, `Append`, `Delete`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T4**: Test each `ObjectOp` variant (`Add`, `Remove`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T5**: Test each `StringOp` variant (`Insert`, `Delete`, `Append`, `Modify`)\n- [ ] **T6**: Test `NumberDelta` with positive, negative, zero, and decimal deltas\n- [ ] **T7**: Test all three `JsonPatchMode` behaviors\n- [ ] **T8**: Test `toDynamicPatch` / `fromDynamicPatch` roundtrip\n- [ ] **T9**: Test edge cases: empty arrays, empty objects, empty strings, nested structures\n- [ ] **T10**: Test error cases: invalid paths, type mismatches, out-of-bounds indices\n\n### Documentation Requirements\n\n- [ ] **D1**: ScalaDoc for all public types and methods\n- [ ] **D2**: Usage examples in ScalaDoc (see sketch for examples)\n- [ ] **D3**: Document algebraic laws in type-level comments\n- [ ] **D4**: Document relationship to `DynamicPatch`\n\n## Related\n\n-

                  "body": "## Overview\n\nImplement a **pure, algebraic migration system** for ZIO Schema 2 that represents **structural transformations between schema versions** as first-class, serializable data.\n\nA migration describes how to transform data from one schema version to another, enabling:\n\n* schema evolution\n* backward / forward compatibility\n* data versioning\n* offline migrations (JSON, SQL, data lakes, registries, etc.)\n\nThe system provides a **typed, macro-validated user API** (`Migration[A, B]`) built on a **pure, serializable core** (`DynamicMigration`) that operates on `DynamicValue`. \n\nThe ADT is fully introspectable and can be used to generate DDL, etc.\n\n## Motivation & Big Picture\n\n### Why structural types?\n\nWhen evolving schemas over time, **older versions of data types should not require runtime representations**.\n\nIn this design:\n\n* **Current versions** are represented by real case classes / enums\n* **Past versions** are represented using:\n\n  * **structural types** for records\n  * **abstract types + intersection types** for sum types\n\nThese types:\n\n* exist **only at compile time**\n* have **no runtime representation**\n* introduce **zero runtime overhead**\n* do **not require optics or instances to be kept around**\n\nThis allows you to describe arbitrarily old versions of data *without polluting your runtime or codebase*.\n\n#### Typical Workflow\n\nA typical workflow looks like:\n\n1. You have a current type:\n\n   ```scala\n   @schema\n   case class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n   ```\n\n2. You derive and copy its structural shape:\n\n   ```scala\n   type PersonV1 = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n   ```\n\n3. You evolve the real type:\n\n   ```scala\n   @schema\n   case class Person(fullName: String, age: Int, country: String)\n   ```\n\n4. You keep only:\n\n   * the **current** runtime type\n   * the **structural type** for the old version\n   * a **pure migration** between them\n\nNo old case classes. No old optics. No runtime baggage.\n\nNote there is no requirement that the \"current\" type actually be a real case class, enum, etc.--so you can work purely with structural types, allowing you to define migrations for data types that are never materialized as runtime structures.\n\n---\n\n### Why pure data migrations?\n\nMigrations are represented entirely as **pure data**:\n\n* no user functions\n* no closures\n* no reflection\n* no runtime code generation\n\nAs a result:\n\n* migrations can be **serialized**\n* stored in **registries**\n* applied **dynamically**\n* inspected and transformed\n* used to generate:\n\n  * upgraders\n  * downgraders\n  * SQL DDL / DML\n  * offline data transforms\n\nWhile code generation is **out of scope for this ticket**, this explains many design decisions (invertibility, path-based actions, no functions).\n\n---\n\n## Core Architecture\n\n### Type Hierarchy\n\n```scala\n// Typed migration (user-facing API)\ncase class Migration[A, B](\n  dynamicMigration: DynamicMigration,\n  sourceSchema: Schema[A], // These are structural schemas!!!\n  targetSchema: Schema[B] // These are structural schemas!!!\n) {\n  /** Apply migration to transform A to B */\n  def apply(value: A): Either[MigrationError, B]\n\n  /** Compose migrations sequentially */\n  def ++[C](that: Migration[B, C]): Migration[A, C]\n\n  /** Alias for ++ */\n  def andThen[C](that: Migration[B, C]): Migration[A, C] = this ++ that\n\n  /** Reverse migration (structural inverse; runtime is best-effort) */\n  def reverse: Migration[B, A]\n}\n```\n\n```scala\n// Untyped migration (pure data, fully serializable)\ncase class DynamicMigration(\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) {\n  def apply(value: DynamicValue): Either[MigrationError, DynamicValue]\n  def ++(that: DynamicMigration): DynamicMigration\n  def reverse: DynamicMigration\n}\n```\n\n* `Migration[A, B]` is introspectable, but not pure data due to bindings inside schemas\n* `DynamicMigration` is **fully serializable**\n\n---\n\n## User-Facing API: Selector Expressions\n\n### Selectors, not optics\n\nThe user-facing API **does not expose optics**.\n\nInstead, all locations are specified using **selector expressions**:\n\n```scala\nS => A\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```scala\n_.name\n_.address.street\n_.addresses.each.streetNumber\n_.country.when[UK]\n```\n\nTo see the syntax, one can look at the `optic` macro, which utilizes the same selector syntax for optic creation (e.g. `optic(_.address.street)`, etc.).\n\n### Macro extraction\n\nAll builder methods that accept selectors are **implemented via macros** (or via a macro-generated type class such as `ToDynamicOptic`).\n\nThe macro:\n\n1. Inspects the selector expression\n2. Validates it is a supported projection\n3. Converts it into a `DynamicOptic`\n4. Stores that optic in the migration action\n\nSupported projections include:\n\n* field access (`_.foo.bar`)\n* case selection (`_.country.when[UK]`)\n* collection traversal (`_.items.each`)\n* (future) key access, wrappers, etc.\n\n`DynamicOptic` is **never exposed publicly**.\n\n---\n\n## Migration Builder\n\nAll selector-accepting methods are implemented via macros. For simplicity, these are shown as functions (e.g. `A => Any`), but this is NOT the way to implement them. Either all these functions need to be macros, or a macro needs to be used to generate an implicit / given at each call site. Macros may do additional validation to constrain the validity of these different types of transformations.\n\n```scala\nclass MigrationBuilder[A, B](\n  sourceSchema: Schema[A],\n  targetSchema: Schema[B],\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) {\n\n  // ----- Record operations -----\n\n  def addField(\n    target: B => Any,\n    default: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def dropField(\n    source: A => Any,\n    defaultForReverse: SchemaExpr[B, ?] = SchemaExpr.DefaultValue\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def renameField(\n    from: A => Any,\n    to: B => Any\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformField(\n    from: A => Any,\n    to: B => Any,\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def mandateField(\n    source: A => Option[?],\n    target: B => Any,\n    default: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def optionalizeField(\n    source: A => Any,\n    target: B => Option[?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def changeFieldType(\n    source: A => Any,\n    target: B => Any,\n    converter: SchemaExpr[A, ?]  // primitive-to-primitive only\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Enum operations (limited) -----\n\n  def renameCase[SumA, SumB](\n    from: String,\n    to: String\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformCase[SumA, CaseA, SumB, CaseB](\n    caseMigration: MigrationBuilder[CaseA, CaseB] => MigrationBuilder[CaseA, CaseB]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Collections -----\n\n  def transformElements(\n    at: A => Vector[?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Maps -----\n\n  def transformKeys(\n    at: A => Map[?, ?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformValues(\n    at: A => Map[?, ?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  /** Build migration with full macro validation */\n  def build: Migration[A, B]\n\n  /** Build migration without full validation */\n  def buildPartial: Migration[A, B]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Migration Actions (Untyped Core)\n\nAll actions operate at a **path**, represented by `DynamicOptic`.\n\n```scala\nsealed trait MigrationAction {\n  def at: DynamicOptic\n  def reverse: MigrationAction\n}\n```\n\n### Record Actions\n\n```scala\ncase class AddField(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  default: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class DropField(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  defaultForReverse: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Rename(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  to: String\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformValue(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Mandate(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  default: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Optionalize(\n  at: DynamicOptic\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Join(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  sourcePaths: Vector[DynamicOptic],\n  combiner: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Split(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  targetPaths: Vector[DynamicOptic],\n  splitter: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class ChangeType(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  converter: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n---\n\n### Enum Actions (Supported)\n\n```scala\ncase class RenameCase(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  from: String,\n  to: String\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformCase(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n> Enum case addition / removal is **out of scope** for this ticket\n> (requires composite value construction).\n\n---\n\n### Collection / Map Actions\n\n```scala\ncase class TransformElements(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformKeys(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformValues(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n---\n\n## SchemaExpr Integration\n\n* Used for all value-level transformations\n* **Constraints for this ticket**:\n\n  * primitive → primitive only\n  * joins / splits must produce primitives\n  * no record / enum construction\n\n### `SchemaExpr.DefaultValue`\n\nA special expression that:\n\n1. uses the macro-captured field schema\n2. calls `schema.defaultValue`\n3. converts the value to `DynamicValue`\n4. is stored for reverse migrations\n\n---\n\n## Type Modeling\n\n### Records (Structural Types)\n\n```scala\ntype PersonV0 = { val firstName: String;

def number: String; def exp: String }\ntype OldWireTransfer =\n  { type Tag = \"WireTransfer\"; def account: String; def routing: String }\ntype OldPaymentMethod = OldCreditCard | OldWireTransfer\n```\n\nMacros extract:\n\n* refinement type → structure of the case\n* type `Tag` with singleton type → case tag\n\n---\n\n## Laws\n\n### Identity\n\n```scala\nMigration.identity[A].apply(a) == Right(a)\n```\n\n### Associativity\n\n```scala\n(m1 ++ m2) ++ m3 == m1 ++ (m2 ++ m3)\n```\n\n### Structural Reverse\n\n```scala\nm.reverse.reverse == m\n```\n\n### Best-Effort Semantic Inverse\n\n```scala\nm.apply(a) == Right(b) ⇒ m.reverse.apply(b) == Right(a)\n```\n\n(when sufficient information exists)\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\n* All runtime errors return `MigrationError`\n* Errors must capture **path information** (`DynamicOptic`)\n* Enables diagnostics such as:\n\n> “Failed to apply TransformValue at `.addresses.each.streetNumber`”\n\n---\n\n## Example\n\n```scala\ntype PersonV0 = { val firstName: String;

              "body": "## Overview\n\nImplement a **pure, algebraic migration system** for ZIO Schema 2 that represents **structural transformations between schema versions** as first-class, serializable data.\n\nA migration describes how to transform data from one schema version to another, enabling:\n\n* schema evolution\n* backward / forward compatibility\n* data versioning\n* offline migrations (JSON, SQL, data lakes, registries, etc.)\n\nThe system provides a **typed, macro-validated user API** (`Migration[A, B]`) built on a **pure, serializable core** (`DynamicMigration`) that operates on `DynamicValue`. \n\nThe ADT is fully introspectable and can be used to generate DDL, etc.\n\n## Motivation & Big Picture\n\n### Why structural types?\n\nWhen evolving schemas over time, **older versions of data types should not require runtime representations**.\n\nIn this design:\n\n* **Current versions** are represented by real case classes / enums\n* **Past versions** are represented using:\n\n  * **structural types** for records\n  * **abstract types + intersection types** for sum types\n\nThese types:\n\n* exist **only at compile time**\n* have **no runtime representation**\n* introduce **zero runtime overhead**\n* do **not require optics or instances to be kept around**\n\nThis allows you to describe arbitrarily old versions of data *without polluting your runtime or codebase*.\n\n#### Typical Workflow\n\nA typical workflow looks like:\n\n1. You have a current type:\n\n   ```scala\n   @schema\n   case class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n   ```\n\n2. You derive and copy its structural shape:\n\n   ```scala\n   type PersonV1 = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n   ```\n\n3. You evolve the real type:\n\n   ```scala\n   @schema\n   case class Person(fullName: String, age: Int, country: String)\n   ```\n\n4. You keep only:\n\n   * the **current** runtime type\n   * the **structural type** for the old version\n   * a **pure migration** between them\n\nNo old case classes. No old optics. No runtime baggage.\n\nNote there is no requirement that the \"current\" type actually be a real case class, enum, etc.--so you can work purely with structural types, allowing you to define migrations for data types that are never materialized as runtime structures.\n\n---\n\n### Why pure data migrations?\n\nMigrations are represented entirely as **pure data**:\n\n* no user functions\n* no closures\n* no reflection\n* no runtime code generation\n\nAs a result:\n\n* migrations can be **serialized**\n* stored in **registries**\n* applied **dynamically**\n* inspected and transformed\n* used to generate:\n\n  * upgraders\n  * downgraders\n  * SQL DDL / DML\n  * offline data transforms\n\nWhile code generation is **out of scope for this ticket**, this explains many design decisions (invertibility, path-based actions, no functions).\n\n---\n\n## Core Architecture\n\n### Type Hierarchy\n\n```scala\n// Typed migration (user-facing API)\ncase class Migration[A, B](\n  dynamicMigration: DynamicMigration,\n  sourceSchema: Schema[A], // These are structural schemas!!!\n  targetSchema: Schema[B] // These are structural schemas!!!\n) {\n  /** Apply migration to transform A to B */\n  def apply(value: A): Either[MigrationError, B]\n\n  /** Compose migrations sequentially */\n  def ++[C](that: Migration[B, C]): Migration[A, C]\n\n  /** Alias for ++ */\n  def andThen[C](that: Migration[B, C]): Migration[A, C] = this ++ that\n\n  /** Reverse migration (structural inverse; runtime is best-effort) */\n  def reverse: Migration[B, A]\n}\n```\n\n```scala\n// Untyped migration (pure data, fully serializable)\ncase class DynamicMigration(\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) {\n  def apply(value: DynamicValue): Either[MigrationError, DynamicValue]\n  def ++(that: DynamicMigration): DynamicMigration\n  def reverse: DynamicMigration\n}\n```\n\n* `Migration[A, B]` is introspectable, but not pure data due to bindings inside schemas\n* `DynamicMigration` is **fully serializable**\n\n---\n\n## User-Facing API: Selector Expressions\n\n### Selectors, not optics\n\nThe user-facing API **does not expose optics**.\n\nInstead, all locations are specified using **selector expressions**:\n\n```scala\nS => A\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```scala\n_.name\n_.address.street\n_.addresses.each.streetNumber\n_.country.when[UK]\n```\n\nTo see the syntax, one can look at the `optic` macro, which utilizes the same selector syntax for optic creation (e.g. `optic(_.address.street)`, etc.).\n\n### Macro extraction\n\nAll builder methods that accept selectors are **implemented via macros** (or via a macro-generated type class such as `ToDynamicOptic`).\n\nThe macro:\n\n1. Inspects the selector expression\n2. Validates it is a supported projection\n3. Converts it into a `DynamicOptic`\n4. Stores that optic in the migration action\n\nSupported projections include:\n\n* field access (`_.foo.bar`)\n* case selection (`_.country.when[UK]`)\n* collection traversal (`_.items.each`)\n* (future) key access, wrappers, etc.\n\n`DynamicOptic` is **never exposed publicly**.\n\n---\n\n## Migration Builder\n\nAll selector-accepting methods are implemented via macros. For simplicity, these are shown as functions (e.g. `A => Any`), but this is NOT the way to implement them. Either all these functions need to be macros, or a macro needs to be used to generate an implicit / given at each call site. Macros may do additional validation to constrain the validity of these different types of transformations.\n\n```scala\nclass MigrationBuilder[A, B](\n  sourceSchema: Schema[A],\n  targetSchema: Schema[B],\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) {\n\n  // ----- Record operations -----\n\n  def addField(\n    target: B => Any,\n    default: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def dropField(\n    source: A => Any,\n    defaultForReverse: SchemaExpr[B, ?] = SchemaExpr.DefaultValue\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def renameField(\n    from: A => Any,\n    to: B => Any\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformField(\n    from: A => Any,\n    to: B => Any,\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def mandateField(\n    source: A => Option[?],\n    target: B => Any,\n    default: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def optionalizeField(\n    source: A => Any,\n    target: B => Option[?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def changeFieldType(\n    source: A => Any,\n    target: B => Any,\n    converter: SchemaExpr[A, ?]  // primitive-to-primitive only\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Enum operations (limited) -----\n\n  def renameCase[SumA, SumB](\n    from: String,\n    to: String\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformCase[SumA, CaseA, SumB, CaseB](\n    caseMigration: MigrationBuilder[CaseA, CaseB] => MigrationBuilder[CaseA, CaseB]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Collections -----\n\n  def transformElements(\n    at: A => Vector[?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  // ----- Maps -----\n\n  def transformKeys(\n    at: A => Map[?, ?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  def transformValues(\n    at: A => Map[?, ?],\n    transform: SchemaExpr[A, ?]\n  ): MigrationBuilder[A, B]\n\n  /** Build migration with full macro validation */\n  def build: Migration[A, B]\n\n  /** Build migration without full validation */\n  def buildPartial: Migration[A, B]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Migration Actions (Untyped Core)\n\nAll actions operate at a **path**, represented by `DynamicOptic`.\n\n```scala\nsealed trait MigrationAction {\n  def at: DynamicOptic\n  def reverse: MigrationAction\n}\n```\n\n### Record Actions\n\n```scala\ncase class AddField(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  default: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class DropField(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  defaultForReverse: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Rename(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  to: String\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformValue(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Mandate(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  default: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Optionalize(\n  at: DynamicOptic\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Join(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  sourcePaths: Vector[DynamicOptic],\n  combiner: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class Split(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  targetPaths: Vector[DynamicOptic],\n  splitter: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class ChangeType(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  converter: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n---\n\n### Enum Actions (Supported)\n\n```scala\ncase class RenameCase(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  from: String,\n  to: String\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformCase(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  actions: Vector[MigrationAction]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n> Enum case addition / removal is **out of scope** for this ticket\n> (requires composite value construction).\n\n---\n\n### Collection / Map Actions\n\n```scala\ncase class TransformElements(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformKeys(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n\ncase class TransformValues(\n  at: DynamicOptic,\n  transform: SchemaExpr[?]\n) extends MigrationAction\n```\n\n---\n\n## SchemaExpr Integration\n\n* Used for all value-level transformations\n* **Constraints for this ticket**:\n\n  * primitive → primitive only\n  * joins / splits must produce primitives\n  * no record / enum construction\n\n### `SchemaExpr.DefaultValue`\n\nA special expression that:\n\n1. uses the macro-captured field schema\n2. calls `schema.defaultValue`\n3. converts the value to `DynamicValue`\n4. is stored for reverse migrations\n\n---\n\n## Type Modeling\n\n### Records (Structural Types)\n\n```scala\ntype PersonV0 = { val firstName: String;

def number: String; def exp: String }\ntype OldWireTransfer =\n  { type Tag = \"WireTransfer\"; def account: String; def routing: String }\ntype OldPaymentMethod = OldCreditCard | OldWireTransfer\n```\n\nMacros extract:\n\n* refinement type → structure of the case\n* type `Tag` with singleton type → case tag\n\n---\n\n## Laws\n\n### Identity\n\n```scala\nMigration.identity[A].apply(a) == Right(a)\n```\n\n### Associativity\n\n```scala\n(m1 ++ m2) ++ m3 == m1 ++ (m2 ++ m3)\n```\n\n### Structural Reverse\n\n```scala\nm.reverse.reverse == m\n```\n\n### Best-Effort Semantic Inverse\n\n```scala\nm.apply(a) == Right(b) ⇒ m.reverse.apply(b) == Right(a)\n```\n\n(when sufficient information exists)\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\n* All runtime errors return `MigrationError`\n* Errors must capture **path information** (`DynamicOptic`)\n* Enables diagnostics such as:\n\n> “Failed to apply TransformValue at `.addresses.each.streetNumber`”\n\n---\n\n## Example\n\n```scala\ntype PersonV0 = { val firstName: String; val lastName: String }\n\n@schema\ncase class Person(fullName: String, age: Int)\n\nval migration =\n  Migration.newBuilder[PersonV0, Person]\n    .addField(_.age, 0)\n    .build\n\nval old =\n  new { val firstName = \"John\";

Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",
