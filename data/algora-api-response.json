This is kinda visible when you look to not run `yarn -s` but just `yarn`:\r\n```\r\ncodespace ➜ /workspaces/e2e-tests/platforms-serverless/firebase-functions (janpio-patch-5 ✗) $ yarn prisma -v\r\nyarn run v1.22.10\r\nwarning package.json: No license field\r\n$ /workspaces/e2e-tests/node_modules/.bin/prisma -v\r\nprisma               : 2.25.0-dev.36\r\n@prisma/client       : 2.25.0-dev.36\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Suggested solution\r\n\r\nOutput the directory of where the executed `prisma` is from, either similar to Yarn the absolute path to the binary in `node_modules`, or the folder where the `package.json` that is responsible for the installation of Prisma comes from.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n\r\nRely on `yarn` itself to give that information. Will not work with `npx` unfortunately for example.",
