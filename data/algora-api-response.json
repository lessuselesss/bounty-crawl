To support any size database we should investigate enhancements to allow any sized database to be exported. Currently the size limitations are 1GB for Durable Objects with 10GB in the future. Operate under the assumption that we might be attempting to dump a 10GB database into a `.sql` file.\n\nAnother consideration to make is because Durable Objects execute synchronous operations we may need to allow for \"breathing intervals\". An example might be we allow our export operation to run for 5 seconds, and take 5 seconds off if other requests are in a queue, then it can pick up again. The goal here would be to prevent locking the database for long periods of time.\n\nBut then poses the questions: \n1. How do we continue operations that need more than 30 seconds to work?\n2. Where is the data stored as it's being created? (R2, S3, something else)?\n3. How do we deliver that dump information to the user after its completed?\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Hit the `/export/dump` endpoint on a large database\n2. Will eventually fail when the 30 second request response time window closes\n\nRun the following command in Terminal (replace the URL with yours) and if your operation exceeds 30 seconds you should see a failed network response instead of a dump file.\n```\ncurl --location 'https://starbasedb.YOUR-ID-HERE.workers.dev/export/dump' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' \\\n--output database_dump.sql\n```\n\nIf you can't create a large enough test database feel free to add code in to `sleep` for 29 seconds before proceeding with the `/export/dump` functional code and should also see the failure.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nAs a user I would expect any and all of the specified data to be dumped out without an error and without partial results. Where it ends up for the user to access if the operation takes more than 30 seconds is up for discussion. Ideally if shorter than 30 seconds it could be returned as our cURL above works today (downloads the file from the response of the origin request), but perhaps after the timeout it continues on uploads it to a destination source to access afterwards?\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n1. For backups require an R2 binding\n2. Have a `.sql` file that gets created in R2 with the filename like `dump_20240101-170000.sql` where it represents `2024-01-01 17:00:00`\n3. Create the file and continuously append new chunks to it until reaching the end\n4. May need to utilize a DO alarm to continue the work after X time if a timeout occurs & mark where it currently is in the process in internal memory so it can pick up and continue.\n5. Provide a callback URL when the operation is finally completed so users can create custom logic to notify them (e.g. Email, Slack, etc)",

                  "body": "I have attached to this ticket a WIT file that describes a generic interface for text-to-speech operations. This interface can be implemented by various providers, either by emulating features not present in a given provider, utilizing the provider's native support for a feature, or indicating an error if a particular combination is not natively supported by a provider.\n\nThe intent of this WIT specification is to allow developers of WASM components (on wasmCloud, Spin, or Golem) to leverage text-to-speech capabilities to build voice-powered applications, accessibility services, and audio content generation systems in a portable and provider-agnostic fashion.\n\nThis ticket involves constructing implementations of this WIT interface for the following providers:\n\n- **ElevenLabs**: The leading AI voice synthesis platform with comprehensive voice cloning, real-time streaming, voice conversion, and sound effects generation capabilities.\n- **AWS Polly**: Amazon's enterprise text-to-speech service with extensive language support, custom lexicons, speech marks, and asynchronous synthesis for long-form content.\n- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech**: Google's neural voice synthesis service with WaveNet and Neural2 voices, device optimization profiles, and streaming synthesis capabilities.\n- **Deepgram Aura**: High-performance real-time TTS with session-based streaming, low-latency neural voices, and conversational AI optimization.\n\nThese implementations must be written in Rust and compilable to WASM Components (WASI 0.23 only, since Golem does not yet support WASI 0.3). The standard Rust toolchain for WASM component development can be employed (see cargo component and the Rust examples of components in this and other Golem repositories).\n\nAdditionally, these implementations should incorporate custom durability semantics using the Golem durability API and the Golem host API. This approach ensures that durability is managed at the level of individual TTS operations (voice synthesis, streaming session creation, voice cloning, batch processing), providing a higher-level and clearer operation log, which aids in debugging and monitoring. See golem:llm and golem:embed for more details and durable implementations in this same repository.\n\nThe final deliverables associated with this ticket are:\n\n- **ElevenLabs implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-elevenlabs.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **AWS Polly implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-polly.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Google Cloud TTS implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-google.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Deepgram Aura implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-deepgram.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n\n**Note**: If you have a strong recommendation to swap out one or two of these with other popular / common TTS providers (such as Azure Cognitive Services Speech, IBM Watson Text to Speech, or OpenAI TTS), then as long as you get permission beforehand, that's okay with me. However, we definitely need ElevenLabs and AWS Polly.\n\nThese components will require runtime configuration, notably API keys, endpoint URLs, authentication credentials, and provider-specific settings. For configuring this information, the components can use environment variables for now (in the future, they will use wasi-runtime-config, but Golem does not support this yet, whereas Golem has good support for environment variables).\n\nMoreover, the Rust components need to be tested within Golem to ensure compatibility with Golem 1.2.x.\n\nThis WIT has been designed by examining and comparing the APIs of ElevenLabs, AWS Polly, Google Cloud TTS, Azure Speech Services, OpenAI TTS, and Deepgram Aura. However, given there are no implementations, it is possible the provided WIT is not the optimal abstraction across all these providers. Therefore, deviations from the proposed design can be made. However, to be accepted, any deviation must be fully justified and deemed by Golem core contributors to be an improvement from the original specification.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\nEach provider implementation should handle the following key mapping considerations:\n\n- **Voice Management**: Map the unified voice resource to provider-specific voice identifiers, handle voice discovery and metadata appropriately for each provider's voice catalog structure\n- **Audio Format Conversion**: Implement native audio format support where available, or provide format conversion for unsupported output formats using audio processing libraries\n- **Streaming Implementation**: Utilize native streaming APIs where supported (ElevenLabs, Deepgram), or implement chunk-based synthesis for providers without native streaming support\n- **Authentication Handling**: Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, service accounts) per provider requirements\n- **Feature Availability**: Route advanced features (voice cloning, sound effects, speech marks) through provider-native APIs where supported, or return `unsupported-operation` errors for unavailable features\n- **Error Mapping**: Map provider-specific HTTP errors and API responses to the unified `tts-error` enumeration with appropriate context preservation\n- **Rate Limiting**: Handle provider-specific rate limits and quota management, implementing appropriate retry logic and error reporting\n- **Long-form Content**: Implement efficient handling of long-form synthesis using provider-native async operations (AWS Polly) or intelligent chunking strategies\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nEach implementation must include comprehensive test suites covering:\n- Basic synthesis operations (text-to-speech with various voices and configurations)\n- Voice discovery and metadata retrieval\n- Streaming synthesis lifecycle (session creation, chunk processing, cleanup)\n- Advanced feature testing (voice cloning, sound effects, custom pronunciations where supported)\n- Audio format validation and quality verification\n- Authentication and authorization scenarios\n- Error handling for unsupported operations and malformed inputs\n- Rate limiting and quota management behavior\n- Connection management and retry logic\n- Long-form content synthesis (>5000 characters)\n- Durability semantics verification across operation boundaries\n- Provider-specific feature utilization (lexicons for Polly, voice settings for ElevenLabs, etc.)\n\n## Configuration Requirements\n\nEach implementation should support the following environment variables:\n\n### Common Configuration\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT`: Custom endpoint URL (for enterprise/regional deployments)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)\n\n### Provider-Specific Configuration\n- **ElevenLabs**: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_MODEL_VERSION`\n- **AWS Polly**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`\n- **Google Cloud**: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`\n- **Deepgram**: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_VERSION`\n\n```wit\npackage

              "body": "I have attached to this ticket a WIT file that describes a generic interface for text-to-speech operations. This interface can be implemented by various providers, either by emulating features not present in a given provider, utilizing the provider's native support for a feature, or indicating an error if a particular combination is not natively supported by a provider.\n\nThe intent of this WIT specification is to allow developers of WASM components (on wasmCloud, Spin, or Golem) to leverage text-to-speech capabilities to build voice-powered applications, accessibility services, and audio content generation systems in a portable and provider-agnostic fashion.\n\nThis ticket involves constructing implementations of this WIT interface for the following providers:\n\n- **ElevenLabs**: The leading AI voice synthesis platform with comprehensive voice cloning, real-time streaming, voice conversion, and sound effects generation capabilities.\n- **AWS Polly**: Amazon's enterprise text-to-speech service with extensive language support, custom lexicons, speech marks, and asynchronous synthesis for long-form content.\n- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech**: Google's neural voice synthesis service with WaveNet and Neural2 voices, device optimization profiles, and streaming synthesis capabilities.\n- **Deepgram Aura**: High-performance real-time TTS with session-based streaming, low-latency neural voices, and conversational AI optimization.\n\nThese implementations must be written in Rust and compilable to WASM Components (WASI 0.23 only, since Golem does not yet support WASI 0.3). The standard Rust toolchain for WASM component development can be employed (see cargo component and the Rust examples of components in this and other Golem repositories).\n\nAdditionally, these implementations should incorporate custom durability semantics using the Golem durability API and the Golem host API. This approach ensures that durability is managed at the level of individual TTS operations (voice synthesis, streaming session creation, voice cloning, batch processing), providing a higher-level and clearer operation log, which aids in debugging and monitoring. See golem:llm and golem:embed for more details and durable implementations in this same repository.\n\nThe final deliverables associated with this ticket are:\n\n- **ElevenLabs implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-elevenlabs.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **AWS Polly implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-polly.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Google Cloud TTS implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-google.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Deepgram Aura implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-deepgram.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n\n**Note**: If you have a strong recommendation to swap out one or two of these with other popular / common TTS providers (such as Azure Cognitive Services Speech, IBM Watson Text to Speech, or OpenAI TTS), then as long as you get permission beforehand, that's okay with me. However, we definitely need ElevenLabs and AWS Polly.\n\nThese components will require runtime configuration, notably API keys, endpoint URLs, authentication credentials, and provider-specific settings. For configuring this information, the components can use environment variables for now (in the future, they will use wasi-runtime-config, but Golem does not support this yet, whereas Golem has good support for environment variables).\n\nMoreover, the Rust components need to be tested within Golem to ensure compatibility with Golem 1.2.x.\n\nThis WIT has been designed by examining and comparing the APIs of ElevenLabs, AWS Polly, Google Cloud TTS, Azure Speech Services, OpenAI TTS, and Deepgram Aura. However, given there are no implementations, it is possible the provided WIT is not the optimal abstraction across all these providers. Therefore, deviations from the proposed design can be made. However, to be accepted, any deviation must be fully justified and deemed by Golem core contributors to be an improvement from the original specification.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\nEach provider implementation should handle the following key mapping considerations:\n\n- **Voice Management**: Map the unified voice resource to provider-specific voice identifiers, handle voice discovery and metadata appropriately for each provider's voice catalog structure\n- **Audio Format Conversion**: Implement native audio format support where available, or provide format conversion for unsupported output formats using audio processing libraries\n- **Streaming Implementation**: Utilize native streaming APIs where supported (ElevenLabs, Deepgram), or implement chunk-based synthesis for providers without native streaming support\n- **Authentication Handling**: Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, service accounts) per provider requirements\n- **Feature Availability**: Route advanced features (voice cloning, sound effects, speech marks) through provider-native APIs where supported, or return `unsupported-operation` errors for unavailable features\n- **Error Mapping**: Map provider-specific HTTP errors and API responses to the unified `tts-error` enumeration with appropriate context preservation\n- **Rate Limiting**: Handle provider-specific rate limits and quota management, implementing appropriate retry logic and error reporting\n- **Long-form Content**: Implement efficient handling of long-form synthesis using provider-native async operations (AWS Polly) or intelligent chunking strategies\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nEach implementation must include comprehensive test suites covering:\n- Basic synthesis operations (text-to-speech with various voices and configurations)\n- Voice discovery and metadata retrieval\n- Streaming synthesis lifecycle (session creation, chunk processing, cleanup)\n- Advanced feature testing (voice cloning, sound effects, custom pronunciations where supported)\n- Audio format validation and quality verification\n- Authentication and authorization scenarios\n- Error handling for unsupported operations and malformed inputs\n- Rate limiting and quota management behavior\n- Connection management and retry logic\n- Long-form content synthesis (>5000 characters)\n- Durability semantics verification across operation boundaries\n- Provider-specific feature utilization (lexicons for Polly, voice settings for ElevenLabs, etc.)\n\n## Configuration Requirements\n\nEach implementation should support the following environment variables:\n\n### Common Configuration\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT`: Custom endpoint URL (for enterprise/regional deployments)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)\n\n### Provider-Specific Configuration\n- **ElevenLabs**: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_MODEL_VERSION`\n- **AWS Polly**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`\n- **Google Cloud**: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`\n- **Deepgram**: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_VERSION`\n\n```wit\npackage

TOON is a compact, human-readable serialization format designed to minimize token usage when passing structured data to Large Language Models, achieving 30-60% token reduction compared to JSON while maintaining lossless bidirectional conversion.\n\nThe implementation will follow the established patterns in zio-blocks, mirroring the architecture of `JsonBinaryCodecDeriver` while adding TOON-specific capabilities for array format selection and indentation-based structure.\n\n---\n\n## Part 1: TOON Format Specification\n\n### 1.1 Overview\n\nTOON was created by Johann Schopplich in 2025 to address the inefficiency of JSON when used in LLM prompts. The format combines YAML-style indentation with CSV-style tabular data representation. The specification is maintained at [[github.com/toon-format/spec](https://github.com/toon-format/spec)](https://github.com/toon-format/spec), currently at version 3.0.\n\n**Design goals:**\n- Minimize token count for LLM context windows\n- Maintain human readability\n- Enable lossless JSON↔TOON conversion\n- Schema-aware encoding for maximum compression\n\n### 1.2 Data Types\n\nTOON supports the complete JSON data model:\n\n| Type | TOON Representation | Example |\n|------|---------------------|---------|\n| String | Unquoted (default) or quoted | `hello` or `\"hello, world\"` |\n| Number | Decimal form only (no scientific notation) | `42`, `3.14159` |\n| Boolean | Lowercase keywords | `true`, `false` |\n| Null | Keyword | `null` |\n| Array | Three formats (see §1.4) | `items[3]: a,b,c` |\n| Object | Indentation-based nesting | See §1.3 |\n\n### 1.3 Object Encoding\n\nObjects use indentation (2 spaces default) with colon-separated key-value pairs:\n\n```toon\nname: Alice\nage: 30\naddress:\n  street: 123 Main St\n  city: Springfield\n```\n\nEquivalent JSON:\n```json\n{\"name\":\"Alice\",\"age\":30,\"address\":{\"street\":\"123 Main St\",\"city\":\"Springfield\"}}\n```\n\n**Key rules:**\n- Keys are unquoted unless they contain special characters\n- Values on the same line as keys (primitives) or indented below (nested structures)\n- Empty objects: just the key with colon and nothing following\n\n### 1.4 Array Encoding Formats\n\nTOON's primary innovation is intelligent array encoding. The format supports three array representations:\n\n#### Tabular Format (Maximum Compression)\n\nFor arrays of uniform objects where all elements share identical keys with only primitive values:\n\n```toon\nusers[3]{id,name,email}:\n  1,Alice,alice@example.com\n  2,Bob,bob@example.com\n  3,Carol,carol@example.com\n```\n\nEquivalent JSON:\n```json\n{\"users\":[{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"Alice\",\"email\":\"alice@example.com\"},{\"id\":2,\"name\":\"Bob\",\"email\":\"bob@example.com\"},{\"id\":3,\"name\":\"Carol\",\"email\":\"carol@example.com\"}]}\n```\n\n**Tabular eligibility requirements:**\n1. All elements must be objects\n2. All objects must have identical keys in the same order\n3. All field values must be primitives (not nested objects or arrays)\n\n#### Inline Format (Primitive Arrays)\n\nFor arrays containing only primitive values:\n\n```toon\ntags[4]: javascript,react,typescript,node\nnumbers[5]: 1,2,3,4,5\n```\n\n#### List Format (Heterogeneous Data)\n\nFor arrays with mixed types, nested structures, or non-uniform objects:\n\n```toon\nitems[3]:\n  - name: Widget\n    price: 9.99\n  - name: Gadget\n    price: 19.99\n  - simple string value\n```\n\n### 1.5 String Quoting Rules\n\nStrings are **unquoted by default**. Quotes are required only when the string contains:\n- The active delimiter (comma by default)\n- A colon `:`\n- Leading or trailing whitespace\n- Control characters\n- The characters `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`\n\n**Escape sequences** (only these five are valid):\n- `\\\\` → backslash\n- `\\\"` → double quote\n- `\\n` → newline\n- `\\r` → carriage return\n- `\\t` → tab\n\n### 1.6 Number Formatting\n\nTOON requires decimal form without scientific notation:\n\n| Value | JSON | TOON |\n|-------|------|------|\n| 15 billion | `1.5e10` | `15000000000` |\n| Tiny | `1e-10` | `0.0000000001` |\n| NaN | N/A | `null` |\n| Infinity | N/A | `null` |\n| -0 | `-0` | `0` |\n\n### 1.7 Key Folding (Optional)\n\nChains of single-key wrapper objects can be collapsed:\n\n```toon\nuser.profile.settings.theme: dark\n```\n\nEquivalent to:\n```toon\nuser:\n  profile:\n    settings:\n      theme: dark\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: ZIO Schema 2 Architecture\n\n### 2.1 Core Abstractions\n\nZIO Schema 2 uses a deriver-based architecture where format codecs are derived from `Schema[A]` definitions. The key components are:\n\n```scala\n// The schema definition\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\nobject Person {\n  implicit val schema: Schema[Person] = Schema.derived\n}\n\n// Deriving a codec\nval jsonCodec: JsonBinaryCodec[Person] = Schema[Person].derive(JsonFormat.deriver)\n```\n\n### 2.2 Deriver Trait\n\nThe `Deriver[TC[_]]` trait defines how to derive type class instances for different schema shapes:\n\n```scala\ntrait Deriver[TC[_]] {\n  def derivePrimitive[F[_, _], A](\n    primitiveType: PrimitiveType[A],\n    typeName: TypeName[A],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Primitive, A],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  ): Lazy[TC[A]]\n\n  def deriveRecord[F[_, _], A](\n    fields: IndexedSeq[Term[F, A, ?]],\n    typeName: TypeName[A],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Record, A],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[A]]\n\n  def deriveVariant[F[_, _], A](\n    cases: IndexedSeq[Term[F, A, ?]],\n    typeName: TypeName[A],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Variant, A],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[A]]\n\n  def deriveSequence[F[_, _], C[_], A](\n    element: Reflect[F, A],\n    typeName: TypeName[C[A]],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Seq[C], C[A]],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[C[A]]]\n\n  def deriveMap[F[_, _], M[_, _], K, V](\n    key: Reflect[F, K],\n    value: Reflect[F, V],\n    typeName: TypeName[M[K, V]],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Map[M], M[K, V]],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[M[K, V]]]\n\n  def deriveDynamic[F[_, _]](\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Dynamic, DynamicValue],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[DynamicValue]]\n\n  def deriveWrapper[F[_, _], A, B](\n    wrapped: Reflect[F, B],\n    typeName: TypeName[A],\n    wrapperPrimitiveType: Option[PrimitiveType[A]],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Wrapper[A, B], A],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[A]]\n}\n```\n\n### 2.3 BinaryCodec Pattern\n\nCodecs extend `BinaryCodec[A]` and work with streaming readers/writers:\n\n```scala\nabstract class JsonBinaryCodec[A](val valueType: Int = JsonBinaryCodec.objectType) \n    extends BinaryCodec[A] {\n  \n  // Core methods to implement\n  def decodeValue(in: JsonReader, default: A): A\n  def encodeValue(x: A, out: JsonWriter): Unit\n  \n  // Optional key encoding (for map keys)\n  def decodeKey(in: JsonReader): A\n  def encodeKey(x: A, out: JsonWriter): Unit\n  \n  // Null value for initialization\n  def nullValue: A = null.asInstanceOf[A]\n  \n  // Public API\n  def decode(input: ByteBuffer, config: ReaderConfig): Either[SchemaError, A]\n  def encode(value: A, output: ByteBuffer, config: WriterConfig): Unit\n}\n```\n\n### 2.4 Configuration Architecture\n\nConfiguration is split between two concerns:\n\n**Semantic configuration** lives on the deriver class itself:\n\n```scala\nclass JsonBinaryCodecDeriver(\n  fieldNameMapper: NameMapper,           // Field name transformation\n  caseNameMapper: NameMapper,            // Case/variant name transformation  \n  discriminatorKind: DiscriminatorKind,  // ADT encoding strategy\n  rejectExtraFields: Boolean,            // Fail on unknown fields\n  enumValuesAsStrings: Boolean,          // Enum encoding style\n  transientNone: Boolean,                // Omit None values\n  requireOptionFields: Boolean,          // Require Option fields\n  transientEmptyCollection: Boolean,     // Omit empty collections\n  requireCollectionFields: Boolean,      // Require collection fields\n  transientDefaultValue: Boolean,        // Omit default-valued fields\n  requireDefaultValueFields: Boolean     // Require fields with defaults\n) extends Deriver[JsonBinaryCodec]\n```\n\n**Runtime configuration** lives in separate config classes:\n\n```scala\n// ReaderConfig: buffer sizes and parsing behavior\nclass ReaderConfig(\n  val preferredBufSize: Int,      // Default: 32768\n  val preferredCharBufSize: Int,  // Default: 4096\n  val maxBufSize: Int,            // Default: 33554432\n  val maxCharBufSize: Int,        // Default: 4194304\n  val checkForEndOfInput: Boolean // Default: true\n)\n\n// WriterConfig: output formatting\nclass WriterConfig(\n  val indentionStep: Int,     // Default: 0 (compact)\n  val preferredBufSize: Int,  // Default: 32768\n  val escapeUnicode: Boolean  // Default: false\n)\n```\n\n### 2.5 DiscriminatorKind for ADTs\n\nSum types (sealed traits) support three encoding strategies:\n\n```scala\nsealed trait DiscriminatorKind\n\nobject DiscriminatorKind {\n  // Wrapper object: {\"Cat\": {\"name\": \"Whiskers\"}}\n  case object Key extends DiscriminatorKind  // DEFAULT\n  \n  // Embedded field: {\"type\": \"Cat\", \"name\": \"Whiskers\"}\n  case class Field(name: String) extends DiscriminatorKind\n  \n  // No discriminator: try each case sequentially\n  case object None extends DiscriminatorKind\n}\n```\n\n### 2.6 NameMapper for Field Transformation\n\n```scala\nsealed trait NameMapper extends (String => String)\n\nobject NameMapper {\n  case object Identity extends NameMapper   // No transformation (default)\n  case object SnakeCase extends NameMapper  // memberName → member_name\n  case object CamelCase extends NameMapper  // member_name → memberName\n  case object PascalCase extends NameMapper // member_name → MemberName\n  case object KebabCase extends NameMapper  // memberName → member-name\n  case class Custom(f: String => String) extends NameMapper\n}\n```\n\n### 2.7 Modifier System\n\nZIO Schema 2 uses `Modifier` classes (not Java annotations) for customization:\n\n```scala\n// Rename a field or case\n@Modifier.rename(\"new_name\")\ncase class Example(field: String)\n\n// Add decoding aliases\n@Modifier.alias(\"old_name\")\ncase object Blue extends Color\n\n// Mark field as transient

\"\\n\"\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 4: Encoding Rules and Algorithms\n\n### 4.1 Array Format Selection Algorithm\n\nWhen `ArrayFormat.Auto` is configured, the encoder must analyze array contents:\n\n```scala\ndef selectArrayFormat[A](elements: Iterable[A], elementCodec: ToonBinaryCodec[A]): ArrayFormat = {\n  if (elements.isEmpty) {\n    ArrayFormat.Inline  // Empty arrays: items[0]:\n  } else if (isPrimitiveCodec(elementCodec)) {\n    ArrayFormat.Inline  // Primitive arrays: items[3]: a,b,c\n  } else if (isUniformObjectArray(elements)) {\n    ArrayFormat.Tabular // Uniform objects: items[N]{fields}: rows...\n  } else {\n    ArrayFormat.List    // Everything else: - item format\n  }\n}\n\ndef isUniformObjectArray[A](elements: Iterable[A]): Boolean = {\n  // Check that:\n  // 1. All elements are objects (case classes)\n  // 2. All have identical field names in same order\n  // 3. All field values are primitives (not nested objects/arrays)\n  ???\n}\n```\n\n### 4.2 String Encoding Rules\n\n```scala\ndef requiresQuoting(s: String, delimiter: Char): Boolean = {\n  s.isEmpty ||\n  s.charAt(0).isWhitespace ||\n  s.charAt(s.length - 1).isWhitespace ||\n  s.indexOf(delimiter) >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf(':') >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf('{') >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf('}') >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf('[') >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf(']') >= 0 ||\n  containsControlCharacters(s)\n}\n\ndef encodeString(s: String, delimiter: Char, out: ToonWriter): Unit = {\n  if (requiresQuoting(s, delimiter)) {\n    out.writeQuotedString(s)  // Escape \\, \", \\n, \\r, \\t\n  } else {\n    out.writeRawString(s)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4.3 Number Encoding Rules\n\n```scala\ndef encodeNumber(n: BigDecimal, out: ToonWriter): Unit = {\n  if (n.isNaN || n.isInfinity) {\n    out.writeNull()\n  } else if (n == BigDecimal(0) && n.signum < 0) {\n    out.writeRaw(\"0\")  // Normalize -0 to 0\n  } else {\n    // Convert to non-exponential decimal form\n    out.writeRaw(n.bigDecimal.toPlainString)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4.4 ADT Encoding with Discriminators\n\n**DiscriminatorKind.Key (default):**\n```toon\nCat:\n  name: Whiskers\n  lives: 9\n```\n\n**DiscriminatorKind.Field(\"type\"):**\n```toon\ntype: Cat\nname: Whiskers\nlives: 9\n```\n\n**DiscriminatorKind.None:**\n```toon\nname: Whiskers\nlives: 9\n```\n(Decoder tries each case sequentially)\n\n### 4.5 Tabular Array Encoding\n\nFor uniform object arrays:\n\n```scala\ndef encodeTabularArray[A](\n  fieldName: String,\n  elements: IndexedSeq[A],\n  fieldNames: IndexedSeq[String],\n  fieldCodecs: IndexedSeq[ToonBinaryCodec[?]],\n  out: ToonWriter\n): Unit = {\n  // Header: fieldName[count]{field1,field2,...}:\n  out.writeRaw(fieldName)\n  out.writeRaw(\"[\")\n  out.writeRaw(elements.length.toString)\n  out.writeRaw(\"]{\")\n  out.writeRaw(fieldNames.mkString(\",\"))\n  out.writeRaw(\"}:\")\n  out.newLine()\n  \n  // Rows: value1,value2,...\n  elements.foreach { element =>\n    out.writeIndent()\n    fieldCodecs.zipWithIndex.foreach { case (codec, idx) =>\n      if (idx > 0) out.writeRaw(\",\")\n      codec.encodeValue(getField(element, idx), out)\n    }\n    out.newLine()\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 5: Acceptance Criteria\n\n### 5.1 Functional Requirements\n\n#### Primitive Types\n- [ ] All primitive types encode/decode correctly: Unit, Boolean, Byte, Short, Int, Long, Float, Double, Char, String, BigInt, BigDecimal\n- [ ] All java.time types: Instant, LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, OffsetDateTime, ZonedDateTime, Duration, Period, Year, YearMonth, MonthDay, Month, DayOfWeek, ZoneId, ZoneOffset\n- [ ] UUID and Currency types\n- [ ] Numbers use decimal form (no scientific notation)\n- [ ] NaN and Infinity encode as `null`\n- [ ] -0 normalizes to 0\n\n#### Strings\n- [ ] Unquoted strings work for simple values\n- [ ] Quoted strings handle delimiters, colons, whitespace, control characters\n- [ ] Only valid escape sequences: `\\\\`, `\\\"`, `\\n`, `\\r`, `\\t`\n- [ ] UTF-8 encoding with LF line endings\n\n#### Arrays\n- [ ] ArrayFormat.Auto selects optimal format\n- [ ] Tabular format for uniform object arrays\n- [ ] Inline format for primitive arrays\n- [ ] List format for heterogeneous data\n- [ ] Array length markers `[N]` are accurate\n- [ ] Empty arrays encode correctly: `items[0]:`\n- [ ] Custom delimiter support (comma, tab, pipe)\n\n#### Objects/Records\n- [ ] Indentation-based nesting works correctly\n- [ ] Field name transformation via NameMapper\n- [ ] Transient field handling (None, empty collections, defaults)\n- [ ] Required field validation\n- [ ] Extra field rejection (configurable)\n- [ ] Modifier.rename and Modifier.alias

(partial wrappers)\n\n#### DynamicValue\n- [ ] Full DynamicValue support for schema-less data\n\n### 5.2 Non-Functional Requirements\n\n#### Performance\n- [ ] Zero-allocation encoding for primitives (use value types)\n- [ ] Streaming encode/decode (no full materialization)\n- [ ] Buffer reuse via thread-local pools\n- [ ] Comparable performance to JSON codec\n\n#### Compatibility\n- [ ] Cross-platform: JVM, Scala.js, Scala Native\n- [ ] Scala 2.13 and Scala 3 support\n- [ ] No runtime reflection\n\n#### Specification Compliance\n- [ ] UTF-8 output with LF line endings\n- [ ] Consistent indentation (configurable, default 2 spaces)\n- [ ] No trailing whitespace\n- [ ] No trailing newline\n- [ ] Accurate array length markers\n- [ ] Preserve object key order\n\n### 5.3 Test Coverage\n\n#### Unit Tests\n- [ ] All primitive codecs round-trip correctly\n- [ ] All array formats encode/decode correctly\n- [ ] All discriminator kinds work\n- [ ] All NameMapper variants work\n-

Configuration reference\n\n---\n\n## Part 6: Reference Implementation Notes\n\n### 6.1 Existing TOON Libraries\n\n**toon4s** (github.com/vim89/toon4s) provides a Scala TOON implementation with:\n- Sealed ADT for TOON values: `ToonValue = TNull | TBool | TNumber | TString | TArray | TObj`\n- JSON↔TOON bidirectional conversion\n- Does NOT provide automatic derivation for case classes\n\n**TypeScript SDK** (github.com/toon-format/toon) is the reference implementation with:\n- Complete parser and serializer\n- Schema-aware encoding\n- Comprehensive test suite\n\n### 6.2 JSON Codec Reference\n\nThe `JsonBinaryCodecDeriver` in zio-blocks serves as the primary reference for implementation patterns:\n- Thread-local caching for recursive types\n- Field info classes for optimized encoding\n- String map for O(1) field lookup during decoding\n- Specialized codecs for primitive arrays\n\n### 6.3 Test Data\n\nThe TOON specification repository includes a test suite at `github.com/toon-format/spec/tree/main/tests` with:\n- Valid TOON documents\n- Invalid TOON documents with expected errors\n- JSON↔TOON conversion pairs\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: Example Encodings\n\n### Simple Record\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\nval person = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n```\n\n**TOON:**\n```toon\nname: Alice\nage: 30\n```\n\n### Nested

users = List(User(1, \"Alice\"), User(2, \"Bob\"))\n```\n\n**TOON:**\n```toon\n[2]{id,name}:\n  1,Alice\n  2,Bob\n```\n\n### Sealed Trait (Key Discriminator)\n```scala\nsealed trait Pet\ncase class Cat(name: String, lives: Int) extends Pet\ncase class Dog(name: String, breed: String) extends Pet\n\nval pet: Pet = Cat(\"Whiskers\", 9)\n```\n\n**TOON:**\n```toon\nCat:\n  name: Whiskers\n  lives: 9\n```\n\n### Sealed Trait (Field Discriminator)\n```scala\n// With: .withDiscriminatorKind(DiscriminatorKind.Field(\"type\"))\n```\n\n**TOON:**\n```toon\ntype: Cat\nname: Whiskers\nlives:

TOON is a compact, human-readable serialization format designed to minimize token usage when passing structured data to Large Language Models, achieving 30-60% token reduction compared to JSON while maintaining lossless bidirectional conversion.\n\nThe implementation will follow the established patterns in zio-blocks, mirroring the architecture of `JsonBinaryCodecDeriver` while adding TOON-specific capabilities for array format selection and indentation-based structure.\n\n---\n\n## Part 1: TOON Format Specification\n\n### 1.1 Overview\n\nTOON was created by Johann Schopplich in 2025 to address the inefficiency of JSON when used in LLM prompts. The format combines YAML-style indentation with CSV-style tabular data representation. The specification is maintained at [[github.com/toon-format/spec](https://github.com/toon-format/spec)](https://github.com/toon-format/spec), currently at version 3.0.\n\n**Design goals:**\n- Minimize token count for LLM context windows\n- Maintain human readability\n- Enable lossless JSON↔TOON conversion\n- Schema-aware encoding for maximum compression\n\n### 1.2 Data Types\n\nTOON supports the complete JSON data model:\n\n| Type | TOON Representation | Example |\n|------|---------------------|---------|\n| String | Unquoted (default) or quoted | `hello` or `\"hello, world\"` |\n| Number | Decimal form only (no scientific notation) | `42`, `3.14159` |\n| Boolean | Lowercase keywords | `true`, `false` |\n| Null | Keyword | `null` |\n| Array | Three formats (see §1.4) | `items[3]: a,b,c` |\n| Object | Indentation-based nesting | See §1.3 |\n\n### 1.3 Object Encoding\n\nObjects use indentation (2 spaces default) with colon-separated key-value pairs:\n\n```toon\nname: Alice\nage: 30\naddress:\n  street: 123 Main St\n  city: Springfield\n```\n\nEquivalent JSON:\n```json\n{\"name\":\"Alice\",\"age\":30,\"address\":{\"street\":\"123 Main St\",\"city\":\"Springfield\"}}\n```\n\n**Key rules:**\n- Keys are unquoted unless they contain special characters\n- Values on the same line as keys (primitives) or indented below (nested structures)\n- Empty objects: just the key with colon and nothing following\n\n### 1.4 Array Encoding Formats\n\nTOON's primary innovation is intelligent array encoding. The format supports three array representations:\n\n#### Tabular Format (Maximum Compression)\n\nFor arrays of uniform objects where all elements share identical keys with only primitive values:\n\n```toon\nusers[3]{id,name,email}:\n  1,Alice,alice@example.com\n  2,Bob,bob@example.com\n  3,Carol,carol@example.com\n```\n\nEquivalent JSON:\n```json\n{\"users\":[{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"Alice\",\"email\":\"alice@example.com\"},{\"id\":2,\"name\":\"Bob\",\"email\":\"bob@example.com\"},{\"id\":3,\"name\":\"Carol\",\"email\":\"carol@example.com\"}]}\n```\n\n**Tabular eligibility requirements:**\n1. All elements must be objects\n2. All objects must have identical keys in the same order\n3. All field values must be primitives (not nested objects or arrays)\n\n#### Inline Format (Primitive Arrays)\n\nFor arrays containing only primitive values:\n\n```toon\ntags[4]: javascript,react,typescript,node\nnumbers[5]: 1,2,3,4,5\n```\n\n#### List Format (Heterogeneous Data)\n\nFor arrays with mixed types, nested structures, or non-uniform objects:\n\n```toon\nitems[3]:\n  - name: Widget\n    price: 9.99\n  - name: Gadget\n    price: 19.99\n  - simple string value\n```\n\n### 1.5 String Quoting Rules\n\nStrings are **unquoted by default**. Quotes are required only when the string contains:\n- The active delimiter (comma by default)\n- A colon `:`\n- Leading or trailing whitespace\n- Control characters\n- The characters `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`\n\n**Escape sequences** (only these five are valid):\n- `\\\\` → backslash\n- `\\\"` → double quote\n- `\\n` → newline\n- `\\r` → carriage return\n- `\\t` → tab\n\n### 1.6 Number Formatting\n\nTOON requires decimal form without scientific notation:\n\n| Value | JSON | TOON |\n|-------|------|------|\n| 15 billion | `1.5e10` | `15000000000` |\n| Tiny | `1e-10` | `0.0000000001` |\n| NaN | N/A | `null` |\n| Infinity | N/A | `null` |\n| -0 | `-0` | `0` |\n\n### 1.7 Key Folding (Optional)\n\nChains of single-key wrapper objects can be collapsed:\n\n```toon\nuser.profile.settings.theme: dark\n```\n\nEquivalent to:\n```toon\nuser:\n  profile:\n    settings:\n      theme: dark\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: ZIO Schema 2 Architecture\n\n### 2.1 Core Abstractions\n\nZIO Schema 2 uses a deriver-based architecture where format codecs are derived from `Schema[A]` definitions. The key components are:\n\n```scala\n// The schema definition\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\nobject Person {\n  implicit val schema: Schema[Person] = Schema.derived\n}\n\n// Deriving a codec\nval jsonCodec: JsonBinaryCodec[Person] = Schema[Person].derive(JsonFormat.deriver)\n```\n\n### 2.2 Deriver Trait\n\nThe `Deriver[TC[_]]` trait defines how to derive type class instances for different schema shapes:\n\n```scala\ntrait Deriver[TC[_]] {\n  def derivePrimitive[F[_, _], A](\n    primitiveType: PrimitiveType[A],\n    typeName: TypeName[A],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Primitive, A],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  ): Lazy[TC[A]]\n\n  def deriveRecord[F[_, _], A](\n    fields: IndexedSeq[Term[F, A, ?]],\n    typeName: TypeName[A],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Record, A],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[A]]\n\n  def deriveVariant[F[_, _], A](\n    cases: IndexedSeq[Term[F, A, ?]],\n    typeName: TypeName[A],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Variant, A],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[A]]\n\n  def deriveSequence[F[_, _], C[_], A](\n    element: Reflect[F, A],\n    typeName: TypeName[C[A]],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Seq[C], C[A]],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[C[A]]]\n\n  def deriveMap[F[_, _], M[_, _], K, V](\n    key: Reflect[F, K],\n    value: Reflect[F, V],\n    typeName: TypeName[M[K, V]],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Map[M], M[K, V]],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[M[K, V]]]\n\n  def deriveDynamic[F[_, _]](\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Dynamic, DynamicValue],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[DynamicValue]]\n\n  def deriveWrapper[F[_, _], A, B](\n    wrapped: Reflect[F, B],\n    typeName: TypeName[A],\n    wrapperPrimitiveType: Option[PrimitiveType[A]],\n    binding: Binding[BindingType.Wrapper[A, B], A],\n    doc: Doc,\n    modifiers: Seq[Modifier.Reflect]\n  )(implicit F: HasBinding[F], D: HasInstance[F]): Lazy[TC[A]]\n}\n```\n\n### 2.3 BinaryCodec Pattern\n\nCodecs extend `BinaryCodec[A]` and work with streaming readers/writers:\n\n```scala\nabstract class JsonBinaryCodec[A](val valueType: Int = JsonBinaryCodec.objectType) \n    extends BinaryCodec[A] {\n  \n  // Core methods to implement\n  def decodeValue(in: JsonReader, default: A): A\n  def encodeValue(x: A, out: JsonWriter): Unit\n  \n  // Optional key encoding (for map keys)\n  def decodeKey(in: JsonReader): A\n  def encodeKey(x: A, out: JsonWriter): Unit\n  \n  // Null value for initialization\n  def nullValue: A = null.asInstanceOf[A]\n  \n  // Public API\n  def decode(input: ByteBuffer, config: ReaderConfig): Either[SchemaError, A]\n  def encode(value: A, output: ByteBuffer, config: WriterConfig): Unit\n}\n```\n\n### 2.4 Configuration Architecture\n\nConfiguration is split between two concerns:\n\n**Semantic configuration** lives on the deriver class itself:\n\n```scala\nclass JsonBinaryCodecDeriver(\n  fieldNameMapper: NameMapper,           // Field name transformation\n  caseNameMapper: NameMapper,            // Case/variant name transformation  \n  discriminatorKind: DiscriminatorKind,  // ADT encoding strategy\n  rejectExtraFields: Boolean,            // Fail on unknown fields\n  enumValuesAsStrings: Boolean,          // Enum encoding style\n  transientNone: Boolean,                // Omit None values\n  requireOptionFields: Boolean,          // Require Option fields\n  transientEmptyCollection: Boolean,     // Omit empty collections\n  requireCollectionFields: Boolean,      // Require collection fields\n  transientDefaultValue: Boolean,        // Omit default-valued fields\n  requireDefaultValueFields: Boolean     // Require fields with defaults\n) extends Deriver[JsonBinaryCodec]\n```\n\n**Runtime configuration** lives in separate config classes:\n\n```scala\n// ReaderConfig: buffer sizes and parsing behavior\nclass ReaderConfig(\n  val preferredBufSize: Int,      // Default: 32768\n  val preferredCharBufSize: Int,  // Default: 4096\n  val maxBufSize: Int,            // Default: 33554432\n  val maxCharBufSize: Int,        // Default: 4194304\n  val checkForEndOfInput: Boolean // Default: true\n)\n\n// WriterConfig: output formatting\nclass WriterConfig(\n  val indentionStep: Int,     // Default: 0 (compact)\n  val preferredBufSize: Int,  // Default: 32768\n  val escapeUnicode: Boolean  // Default: false\n)\n```\n\n### 2.5 DiscriminatorKind for ADTs\n\nSum types (sealed traits) support three encoding strategies:\n\n```scala\nsealed trait DiscriminatorKind\n\nobject DiscriminatorKind {\n  // Wrapper object: {\"Cat\": {\"name\": \"Whiskers\"}}\n  case object Key extends DiscriminatorKind  // DEFAULT\n  \n  // Embedded field: {\"type\": \"Cat\", \"name\": \"Whiskers\"}\n  case class Field(name: String) extends DiscriminatorKind\n  \n  // No discriminator: try each case sequentially\n  case object None extends DiscriminatorKind\n}\n```\n\n### 2.6 NameMapper for Field Transformation\n\n```scala\nsealed trait NameMapper extends (String => String)\n\nobject NameMapper {\n  case object Identity extends NameMapper   // No transformation (default)\n  case object SnakeCase extends NameMapper  // memberName → member_name\n  case object CamelCase extends NameMapper  // member_name → memberName\n  case object PascalCase extends NameMapper // member_name → MemberName\n  case object KebabCase extends NameMapper  // memberName → member-name\n  case class Custom(f: String => String) extends NameMapper\n}\n```\n\n### 2.7 Modifier System\n\nZIO Schema 2 uses `Modifier` classes (not Java annotations) for customization:\n\n```scala\n// Rename a field or case\n@Modifier.rename(\"new_name\")\ncase class Example(field: String)\n\n// Add decoding aliases\n@Modifier.alias(\"old_name\")\ncase object Blue extends Color\n\n// Mark field as transient (excluded from serialization)\n@Modifier.transient()\nval internalField: Int = 0\n```\n\nProgrammatic application:\n```scala\nval codec = Color.schema\n  .deriving(JsonBinaryCodecDeriver)\n  .modifier(Color.red, Modifier.rename(\"Rose\"))\n  .modifier(Color.red, Modifier.alias(\"Ruby\"))\n  .derive\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 3: TOON Implementation Design\n\n### 3.1 Module

\"\\n\"\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 4: Encoding Rules and Algorithms\n\n### 4.1 Array Format Selection Algorithm\n\nWhen `ArrayFormat.Auto` is configured, the encoder must analyze array contents:\n\n```scala\ndef selectArrayFormat[A](elements: Iterable[A], elementCodec: ToonBinaryCodec[A]): ArrayFormat = {\n  if (elements.isEmpty) {\n    ArrayFormat.Inline  // Empty arrays: items[0]:\n  } else if (isPrimitiveCodec(elementCodec)) {\n    ArrayFormat.Inline  // Primitive arrays: items[3]: a,b,c\n  } else if (isUniformObjectArray(elements)) {\n    ArrayFormat.Tabular // Uniform objects: items[N]{fields}: rows...\n  } else {\n    ArrayFormat.List    // Everything else: - item format\n  }\n}\n\ndef isUniformObjectArray[A](elements: Iterable[A]): Boolean = {\n  // Check that:\n  // 1. All elements are objects (case classes)\n  // 2. All have identical field names in same order\n  // 3. All field values are primitives (not nested objects/arrays)\n  ???\n}\n```\n\n### 4.2 String Encoding Rules\n\n```scala\ndef requiresQuoting(s: String, delimiter: Char): Boolean = {\n  s.isEmpty ||\n  s.charAt(0).isWhitespace ||\n  s.charAt(s.length - 1).isWhitespace ||\n  s.indexOf(delimiter) >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf(':') >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf('{') >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf('}') >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf('[') >= 0 ||\n  s.indexOf(']') >= 0 ||\n  containsControlCharacters(s)\n}\n\ndef encodeString(s: String, delimiter: Char, out: ToonWriter): Unit = {\n  if (requiresQuoting(s, delimiter)) {\n    out.writeQuotedString(s)  // Escape \\, \", \\n, \\r, \\t\n  } else {\n    out.writeRawString(s)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4.3 Number Encoding Rules\n\n```scala\ndef encodeNumber(n: BigDecimal, out: ToonWriter): Unit = {\n  if (n.isNaN || n.isInfinity) {\n    out.writeNull()\n  } else if (n == BigDecimal(0) && n.signum < 0) {\n    out.writeRaw(\"0\")  // Normalize -0 to 0\n  } else {\n    // Convert to non-exponential decimal form\n    out.writeRaw(n.bigDecimal.toPlainString)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4.4 ADT Encoding with Discriminators\n\n**DiscriminatorKind.Key (default):**\n```toon\nCat:\n  name: Whiskers\n  lives: 9\n```\n\n**DiscriminatorKind.Field(\"type\"):**\n```toon\ntype: Cat\nname: Whiskers\nlives: 9\n```\n\n**DiscriminatorKind.None:**\n```toon\nname: Whiskers\nlives: 9\n```\n(Decoder tries each case sequentially)\n\n### 4.5 Tabular Array Encoding\n\nFor uniform object arrays:\n\n```scala\ndef encodeTabularArray[A](\n  fieldName: String,\n  elements: IndexedSeq[A],\n  fieldNames: IndexedSeq[String],\n  fieldCodecs: IndexedSeq[ToonBinaryCodec[?]],\n  out: ToonWriter\n): Unit = {\n  // Header: fieldName[count]{field1,field2,...}:\n  out.writeRaw(fieldName)\n  out.writeRaw(\"[\")\n  out.writeRaw(elements.length.toString)\n  out.writeRaw(\"]{\")\n  out.writeRaw(fieldNames.mkString(\",\"))\n  out.writeRaw(\"}:\")\n  out.newLine()\n  \n  // Rows: value1,value2,...\n  elements.foreach { element =>\n    out.writeIndent()\n    fieldCodecs.zipWithIndex.foreach { case (codec, idx) =>\n      if (idx > 0) out.writeRaw(\",\")\n      codec.encodeValue(getField(element, idx), out)\n    }\n    out.newLine()\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 5: Acceptance Criteria\n\n### 5.1 Functional Requirements\n\n#### Primitive Types\n- [ ] All

Sealed ADT for TOON values: `ToonValue = TNull | TBool | TNumber | TString | TArray | TObj`\n- JSON↔TOON bidirectional conversion\n- Does NOT provide automatic derivation for case classes\n\n**TypeScript SDK** (github.com/toon-format/toon) is the reference implementation with:\n- Complete parser and serializer\n- Schema-aware encoding\n- Comprehensive test suite\n\n### 6.2 JSON Codec Reference\n\nThe `JsonBinaryCodecDeriver` in zio-blocks serves as the primary reference for implementation patterns:\n- Thread-local caching for recursive types\n- Field info classes for optimized encoding\n- String map for O(1) field lookup during decoding\n- Specialized codecs for primitive arrays\n\n### 6.3 Test Data\n\nThe TOON specification repository includes a test suite at `github.com/toon-format/spec/tree/main/tests` with:\n- Valid TOON documents\n- Invalid TOON documents with expected errors\n- JSON↔TOON conversion pairs\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: Example

users = List(User(1, \"Alice\"), User(2, \"Bob\"))\n```\n\n**TOON:**\n```toon\n[2]{id,name}:\n  1,Alice\n  2,Bob\n```\n\n### Sealed Trait (Key Discriminator)\n```scala\nsealed trait Pet\ncase class Cat(name: String, lives: Int) extends Pet\ncase class Dog(name: String, breed: String) extends Pet\n\nval pet: Pet = Cat(\"Whiskers\", 9)\n```\n\n**TOON:**\n```toon\nCat:\n  name: Whiskers\n  lives:

                  "body": "## Overview\n\nImplement a **pure, algebraic migration system** for ZIO Schema 2 that represents **structural transformations between schema versions** as first-class, serializable data.\n\nA migration describes how to transform data from one schema version to another, enabling:\n\n* schema evolution\n* backward / forward compatibility\n* data versioning\n* offline migrations (JSON, SQL, data lakes, registries, etc.)\n\nThe system provides a **typed, macro-validated user API** (`Migration[A, B]`) built on a **pure, serializable core** (`DynamicMigration`) that operates on `DynamicValue`. \n\nThe ADT is fully introspectable and can be used to generate DDL, etc.\n\n## Motivation & Big Picture\n\n### Why structural types?\n\nWhen evolving schemas over time, **older versions of data types should not require runtime representations**.\n\nIn this design:\n\n* **Current versions** are represented by real case classes / enums\n* **Past versions** are represented using:\n\n  * **structural types** for records\n  * **abstract types + intersection types** for sum types\n\nThese types:\n\n* exist **only at compile time**\n* have **no runtime representation**\n* introduce **zero runtime overhead**\n* do **not require optics or instances to be kept around**\n\nThis allows you to describe arbitrarily old versions of data *without polluting your runtime or codebase*.\n\n#### Typical Workflow\n\nA typical workflow looks like:\n\n1. You have a current type:\n\n   ```scala\n   @schema\n   case class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n   ```\n\n2. You derive and copy its structural shape:\n\n   ```scala\n   type PersonV1 = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n   ```\n\n3.

You have a current type:\n\n   ```scala\n   @schema\n   case class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n   ```\n\n2. You derive and copy its structural shape:\n\n   ```scala\n   type PersonV1 = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n   ```\n\n3. You evolve the real type:\n\n   ```scala\n   @schema\n   case class Person(fullName: String, age: Int, country: String)\n   ```\n\n4.

                  "body": "## Overview\n\nAdd two related type classes for type-safe schema evolution:\n\n1. **`Into[A, B]`**: One-way conversion from `A` to `B` with runtime validation\n2. **`As[A, B]`**: Bidirectional conversion establishing a partial equivalence between `A` and `B`\n\nBoth type classes are automatically derived via macros that intelligently map fields using names, positions, and types, with support for validation, coercion, and schema evolution patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Type Class Definitions\n\n### Into[A, B] - One-Way Conversion\n\n```scala\ntrait Into[-A, +B] {\n  def into(input: A): Either[SchemaError, B]\n}\n```\n\n**Purpose**: Convert from source type `A` to target type `B`, potentially failing at runtime when validation constraints cannot be satisfied.\n\n**Use Cases**:\n- Migrating between schema versions\n- Converting between equivalent representations\n- Validating conversions with opaque types\n- Transforming external data into internal models\n\n### As[A, B] - Bidirectional Conversion\n\n```scala\ntrait As[A, B] {\n  def into(input: A): Either[SchemaError, B]\n  def from(input: B): Either[SchemaError, A]\n}\n```\n\n**Purpose**: Establish a partial equivalence between types `A` and `B` where conversion can fail in either direction due to runtime validation.\n\n**Use Cases**:\n- Isomorphic schema versions\n- Equivalent representations (e.g., case class ↔ tuple)\n- Reversible transformations with runtime validation\n- Round-trip serialization/deserialization\n\n**Relationship**: `As[A, B]` implies both `Into[A, B]` and `Into[B, A]` exist, but with the additional guarantee that both conversions use compatible mapping logic and can round-trip (subject to runtime validation).\n\n**Note**: `SchemaError` is composable, allowing multiple validation failures to be combined into a single error.\n\n---\n\n## Core Conversion Rules\n\n### Field Mapping Algorithm\n\nThe macro establishes field mappings using three attributes:\n1. **Field name** (identifier in source code)\n2. **Field position** (ordinal position in declaration)\n3. **Field type** (including coercible types)\n\n**Priority for disambiguation:**\n1. **Exact match**: Same name + same type\n2. **Name match with coercion**: Same name + coercible type\n3. **Unique type match**: Type appears only once in both source and target\n4. **Position + unique type**: Positional correspondence with unambiguous type\n5. **Fallback**: If no unambiguous mapping exists, derivation fails at compile-time\n\n### Mapping Examples\n\n#### Unambiguous by Unique Types\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int, active: Boolean)\ncase class User(username: String, yearsOld: Int, enabled: Boolean)\n\n// Success: Each type appears exactly once\n// Mapping: String→String, Int→Int, Boolean→Boolean\n```\n\n#### Unambiguous by Names\n```scala\ncase class Point(x: Int, y: Int)\ncase class Coord(y: Int, x: Int)\n\n// Success: Names uniquely identify despite reordering\n// Mapping: x→x, y→y\n```\n\n#### Ambiguous - Compile Failure\n```scala\ncase class Dimensions(width: Int, height: Int)\ncase class Measurements(first: Int, second: Int)\n\n// COMPILE ERROR: Cannot determine mapping\n// Both Int types, different names, ambiguous positional match\n```\n\n#### Disambiguation by Position (Tuples)\n```scala\ncase class RGB(r: Int, g: Int, b: Int)\ntype ColorTuple = (Int, Int, Int)\n\n// Success: Position disambiguates\n// Mapping: r→_1, g→_2, b→_3\n```\n\n---\n\n## Supported Conversions\n\n### 1. Product Types (Records)\n\n#### Case Class to Case Class\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(fullName: String, age: Int)\n\n// Success if 'name' is unique String in V1 and 'fullName' is unique String in V2\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", 30))\n```\n\n#### Case Class to Tuple\n```scala\ncase class Point(x: Double, y: Double)\n\nInto[Point, (Double, Double)].into(Point(1.0, 2.0))\n// => Right((1.0, 2.0))\n```\n\n#### Tuple to Case Class\n```scala\ncase class RGB(red: Int, green: Int, blue: Int)\n\nInto[(Int, Int, Int), RGB].into((255, 128, 64))\n// => Right(RGB(255, 128, 64))\n```\n\n#### Tuple to Tuple\n```scala\nInto[(Int, String), (Long, String)].into((42, \"hello\"))\n// => Right((42L, \"hello\"))\n```\n\n### 2. Coproduct Types (Sum Types)\n\n#### Sealed Trait to Sealed Trait (by name)\n```scala\nsealed trait Color\ncase object Red extends Color\ncase object Blue extends Color\n\nsealed trait Hue\ncase object Red extends Hue\ncase object Blue extends Hue\n\nInto[Color, Hue].into(Red)\n// => Right(Red)\n```\n\n#### Sealed Trait to Sealed Trait (by signature)\n```scala\nsealed trait EventV1\ncase class Created(id: String, ts: Long) extends EventV1\ncase class Deleted(id: String) extends EventV1\n\nsealed trait EventV2\ncase class Spawned(id: String, ts: Long) extends EventV2\ncase class Removed(id: String) extends EventV2\n\nInto[EventV1, EventV2].into(Created(\"abc\", 123L))\n// => Right(Spawned(\"abc\", 123L))\n// Matched by constructor signature (String, Long)\n```\n\n#### Enum to Enum (Scala 3)\n```scala\nenum Status:\n  case Active, Inactive, Suspended\n\nenum State:\n  case Active, Inactive, Suspended\n\nInto[Status, State].into(Status.Active)\n// => Right(State.Active)\n```\n\n#### ADT with Payload Conversion\n```scala\nsealed trait ResultV1\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends ResultV1\ncase class Failure(msg: String) extends ResultV1\n\nsealed trait ResultV2\ncase class Success(value: Long) extends ResultV2\ncase class Failure(msg: String) extends ResultV2\n\nInto[ResultV1, ResultV2].into(Success(42))\n// => Right(Success(42L))\n// Field type coercion within matched case\n```\n\n### 3.

Collection Type Conversions\n\n#### Between Standard Collection Types\n```scala\nInto[List[Int], Vector[Int]].into(List(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(Vector(1, 2, 3))\n\nInto[Vector[String], List[String]].into(Vector(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"))\n// => Right(List(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"))\n\nInto[Array[Int], List[Int]].into(Array(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(List(1, 2, 3))\n\nInto[List[Int], Array[Int]].into(List(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(Array(1, 2, 3))\n\nInto[Seq[Int], List[Int]].into(Seq(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(List(1, 2, 3))\n\nInto[List[Int], Seq[Int]].into(List(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(Seq(1, 2, 3))\n```\n\n#### Set Conversions (Order-Preserving Collections to Set)\n```scala\nInto[List[Int], Set[Int]].into(List(1, 2, 2, 3))\n// => Right(Set(1, 2, 3))\n// Note: Duplicates are removed\n\nInto[Vector[String], Set[String]].into(Vector(\"a\", \"b\", \"a\"))\n// => Right(Set(\"a\", \"b\"))\n```\n\n#### Set to Order-Preserving Collections\n```scala\nInto[Set[Int], List[Int]].into(Set(3, 1, 2))\n// => Right(List(1, 2, 3))\n// Note: Order is determined by Set's iteration order\n\nInto[Set[String], Vector[String]].into(Set(\"c\", \"a\", \"b\"))\n// => Right(Vector(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"))\n```\n\n#### Combined Element and Collection Type Conversion\n```scala\nInto[List[Int], Vector[Long]].into(List(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(Vector(1L, 2L, 3L))\n\nInto[Array[Short], List[Int]].into(Array(10.toShort, 20.toShort))\n// => Right(List(10, 20))\n\nInto[Set[Int], List[Long]].into(Set(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(List(1L, 2L, 3L))\n```\n\n#### Nested Collection Type Conversions\n```scala\nInto[List[Vector[Int]], Vector[List[Long]]].into(List(Vector(1, 2), Vector(3, 4)))\n// => Right(Vector(List(1L, 2L), List(3L, 4L)))\n```\n\n### 5. Structural Types\n\n#### Structural Type Targets (Scala 3 with Selectable)\n```scala\ncase class Point(x: Int, y: Int)\ntype Coord = { def x: Int; def y: Int }\n\nInto[Point, Coord].into(Point(5, 10))\n// => Right(<structural instance with x=5, y=10>)\n```\n\n#### Structural Type Targets (Scala 2 with Dynamic)\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\ntype Record = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\nInto[Person, Record].into(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n// => Right(<dynamic instance with name=\"Alice\", age=30>)\n```\n\n#### Structural Type Sources\n```scala\ntype PersonLike = { def name: String; def age: Int }\ncase class User(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval personLike: PersonLike = ??? // some structural instance\nInto[PersonLike, User].into(personLike)\n// => Right(User(\"Alice\", 30))\n```\n\n### 6. Schema Evolution Patterns\n\n#### Adding Optional Fields\n```scala\ncase class UserV1(id: String, name: String)\ncase class UserV2(id: String, name: String, email: Option[String])\n\nInto[UserV1, UserV2].into(UserV1(\"123\", \"Alice\"))\n// => Right(UserV2(\"123\", \"Alice\", None))\n```\n\n#### Removing Optional Fields\n```scala\ncase class UserV2(id: String, name: String, email: Option[String])\ncase class UserV1(id: String, name: String)\n\nInto[UserV2, UserV1].into(UserV2(\"123\", \"Alice\", Some(\"alice@example.com\")))\n// => Right(UserV1(\"123\", \"Alice\"))\n// email field is dropped\n```\n\n#### Adding Required Fields with Defaults (Scala 3)\n```scala\ncase class ProductV1(name: String, price: Double)\ncase class ProductV2(name: String, price: Double, available: Boolean = true)\n\nInto[ProductV1, ProductV2].into(ProductV1(\"Widget\", 19.99))\n// => Right(ProductV2(\"Widget\", 19.99, true))\n```\n\n#### Field Reordering\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int, email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(email: String, name: String, age: Int)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30, \"alice@example.com\"))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"alice@example.com\", \"Alice\", 30))\n```\n\n#### Field Renaming (with unique types)\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(fullName: String, yearOfBirth: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, birthYear: Int)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice Smith\", 1990))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice Smith\", 1990))\n```\n\n#### Type Refinement\n```scala\ncase class ConfigV1(port: Int, timeout: Int)\ncase class ConfigV2(port: Int, timeout: Long)\n\nInto[ConfigV1, ConfigV2].into(ConfigV1(8080, 30))\n// => Right(ConfigV2(8080, 30L))\n```\n\n### 7. Nested Conversions\n\n#### Nested Products\n```scala\ncase class AddressV1(street: String, zip: Int)\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, address: AddressV1)\n\ncase class AddressV2(street: String, zip: Long)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, address: AddressV2)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(\n  PersonV1(\"Alice\", AddressV1(\"Main St\", 12345))\n)\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", AddressV2(\"Main St\", 12345L)))\n```\n\n#### Nested Coproducts\n```scala\nsealed trait Inner\ncase class A(x: Int) extends Inner\ncase class B(y: String) extends Inner\n\nsealed trait Outer\ncase class Container(inner: Inner, label: String) extends Outer\n\n// Similar target types with Long instead of Int\nsealed trait InnerV2\ncase class A(x: Long) extends InnerV2\ncase class B(y: String) extends InnerV2\n\nsealed trait OuterV2\ncase class Container(inner: InnerV2, label: String) extends OuterV2\n\nInto[Outer, OuterV2].into(Container(A(42), \"test\"))\n// => Right(Container(A(42L), \"test\"))\n```\n\n#### Collections of Complex Types\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Long)\n\nInto[List[PersonV1], List[PersonV2]].into(\n  List(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30), PersonV1(\"Bob\", 25))\n)\n// => Right(List(PersonV2(\"Alice\", 30L), PersonV2(\"Bob\", 25L)))\n```\n\n#### Nested Collections with Type Conversions\n```scala\ncase class DataV1(values: List[Vector[Int]])\ncase class DataV2(values: Vector[List[Long]])\n\nInto[DataV1, DataV2].into(\n  DataV1(List(Vector(1, 2), Vector(3, 4)))\n)\n// => Right(DataV2(Vector(List(1L, 2L), List(3L, 4L))))\n```\n\n---\n\n## Special Type Support\n\n### Opaque Types (Scala 3)\n\nOpaque types with validation are fully supported. The macro generates runtime validation calls.\n\n```scala\n// Definition with validation\nobject Domain:\n  opaque type Age = Int\n  object Age:\n    def apply(value: Int): Either[String, Age] =\n      if value >= 0 && value <= 150 then Right(value)\n      else Left(s\"Invalid age: $value\")\n    \n    def unsafe(value: Int): Age = value\n    \n    extension (age: Age)\n      def toInt: Int = age\n\n  opaque type Email = String\n  object Email:\n    def apply(value: String): Either[String, Email] =\n      if value.contains(\"@\") then Right(value)\n      else Left(s\"Invalid email: $value\")\n    \n    extension (email: Email)\n      def toString: String = email\n\nimport Domain._\n\n// Usage\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int, email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Age, email: Email)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30, \"alice@example.com\"))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", Age.unsafe(30), Email.unsafe(\"alice@example.com\")))\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", -5, \"alice@example.com\"))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Age validation failed: Invalid age: -5\"))\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30, \"invalid\"))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Email validation failed: Invalid email: invalid\"))\n```\n\n**Macro Behavior**:\n- Detects opaque type companion objects with `apply(underlying): Either[_, OpaqueType]` method\n- Generates validation calls for each opaque type field\n- Accumulates all validation errors using `SchemaError` composition\n- Falls back to direct conversion if no validation method exists\n\n### Newtype Libraries (Scala 2)\n\n#### ZIO Prelude Newtypes (Built-in Support)\n\nThe macro includes hardcoded support for ZIO Prelude newtypes without requiring a compile-time dependency.\n\n```scala\nimport zio.prelude._\n\n// Definition with validation\nobject Domain {\n  object Age extends Subtype[Int] {\n    override def assertion = assert {\n      Assertion.between(0, 150)\n    }\n  }\n  type Age = Age.Type\n\n  object Email extends Newtype[String] {\n    override def assertion = assert {\n      Assertion.matches(\".*@.*\")\n    }\n  }\n  type Email = Email.Type\n}\n\nimport Domain._\n\n// Usage\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int, email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Age, email: Email)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30, \"alice@example.com\"))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", Age(30), Email(\"alice@example.com\")))\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 200, \"invalid\"))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Validation failed: age: 200 is not between 0 and 150, email: invalid does not match .*@.*\"))\n```\n\n**Macro Detection** (no ZIO Prelude dependency required):\n```scala\n// The macro detects ZIO Prelude newtypes by checking:\n// 1. Type extends Newtype[A] or Subtype[A]\n// 2. Companion object exists\n// 3. Has apply/wrap method with validation\n\n// Low-level AST matching in Scala 2 macro:\ndef isZIONewtype(tpe: Type): Boolean = {\n  tpe.typeSymbol.fullName.startsWith(\"zio.prelude.Newtype\") ||\n  tpe.typeSymbol.fullName.startsWith(\"zio.prelude.Subtype\")\n}\n```\n\n#### Other Newtype Libraries\n\nFor other newtype libraries, users can provide explicit `Into` instances. The macro will use these instances when available.\n\n```scala\n// User-provided instance for their newtype library\nimplicit val stringToMyNewtype: Into[String, MyNewtype] = \n  new Into[String, MyNewtype] {\n    def into(s: String): Either[SchemaError, MyNewtype] =\n      MyNewtype.make(s).left.map(e => SchemaError(e.toString))\n  }\n\n// The macro will automatically use this instance\ncase class PersonV1(email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(email: MyNewtype)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"test@example.com\"))\n// Uses the user-provided instance automatically\n```\n\n### Validation Error Accumulation\n\nWhen multiple validations fail, all errors are accumulated using `SchemaError` composition:\n\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int, email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Age, email: Email)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"\", -5, \"invalid\"))\n// => Left(SchemaError(...)) // Combined error containing all validation failures\n```\n\n---\n\n## As[A, B] Additional Requirements\n\nFor `As[A, B]` to be derivable, the bidirectional conversion must be **compatible**:\n\n### Compatibility Rules\n\n1. **Field mappings must be consistent**: The same field correspondence in both directions\n2. **Coercions must be invertible with runtime validation**: \n   - ✅ `Int` ↔ `Long` is valid (narrowing validated at runtime)\n   - ✅ `Float` ↔ `Double` is valid (narrowing validated at runtime)\n   - ✅ All numeric coercions are valid with runtime checks\n3. **Optional fields**: \n   - ✅ Can add optional fields in one direction (becomes `None` in reverse)\n   - ✅ Can remove optional fields in one direction (value is dropped)\n4. **Default values**:\n   - ❌ Cannot use default arguments (breaks round-trip guarantee)\n5. **Collection types**:\n   - ✅ Can convert between different collection types\n   - ⚠️  Set → List → Set may not preserve original order\n   - ⚠️  List → Set → List loses duplicates\n\n### Valid As[A, B] Examples\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Same structure, different names\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(fullName: String, yearsOld: Int)\n\nAs[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", 30))\n\nAs[PersonV1, PersonV2].from(PersonV2(\"Bob\", 25))\n// => Right(PersonV1(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Case class ↔ Tuple\ncase class Point(x: Double, y: Double)\n\nAs[Point, (Double, Double)].into(Point(1.0, 2.0))\n// => Right((1.0, 2.0))\n\nAs[Point, (Double, Double)].from((3.0, 4.0))\n// => Right(Point(3.0, 4.0))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Numeric coercion with runtime validation\ncase class ConfigV1(timeout: Int)\ncase class ConfigV2(timeout: Long)\n\nAs[ConfigV1, ConfigV2].into(ConfigV1(30))\n// => Right(ConfigV2(30L))\n\nAs[ConfigV1, ConfigV2].from(ConfigV2(30L))\n// => Right(ConfigV1(30))\n\nAs[ConfigV1, ConfigV2].from(ConfigV2(3000000000L))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Value 3000000000 exceeds Int.MaxValue\"))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Opaque types (reversible via unwrap)\ncase class PersonRaw(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonValidated(name: String, age: Age)\n\nAs[PersonRaw, PersonValidated].into(PersonRaw(\"Alice\", 30))\n// => Right(PersonValidated(\"Alice\", Age.unsafe(30)))\n\nAs[PersonRaw, PersonValidated].from(PersonValidated(\"Bob\", Age.unsafe(25)))\n// => Right(PersonRaw(\"Bob\", 25))\n\nAs[PersonRaw, PersonValidated].into(PersonRaw(\"Charlie\", -5))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Age validation failed: Invalid age: -5\"))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Collection type conversions\ncase class DataV1(items: List[Int])\ncase class DataV2(items: Vector[Int])\n\nAs[DataV1, DataV2].into(DataV1(List(1, 2, 3)))\n// => Right(DataV2(Vector(1, 2, 3)))\n\nAs[DataV1, DataV2].from(DataV2(Vector(4, 5, 6)))\n// => Right(DataV1(List(4, 5, 6)))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Optional field in one direction\ncase class UserV1(id: String, name: String)\ncase class UserV2(id: String, name: String, email: Option[String])\n\nAs[UserV1, UserV2].into(UserV1(\"123\", \"Alice\"))\n// => Right(UserV2(\"123\", \"Alice\", None))\n\nAs[UserV1, UserV2].from(UserV2(\"456\", \"Bob\", Some(\"bob@example.com\")))\n// => Right(UserV1(\"456\", \"Bob\"))\n// email is dropped in reverse direction\n```\n\n### Non-Ideal As[A, B] Examples (Valid but Lossy)\n\n```scala\n// Valid but lossy: List with duplicates → Set → List\ncase class DataV1(values: List[Int])\ncase class DataV2(values: Set[Int])\n\nAs[DataV1, DataV2].into(DataV1(List(1, 2, 2, 3)))\n// => Right(DataV2(Set(1, 2, 3)))\n\nAs[DataV1, DataV2].from(DataV2(Set(1, 2, 3)))\n// => Right(DataV1(List(1, 2, 3)))\n// Original duplicates are lost, but conversion is valid\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid but lossy: Set → List → Set (order may change)\ncase class DataV1(values: Set[Int])\ncase class DataV2(values: List[Int])\n\nval original = DataV1(Set(3, 1, 2))\nval converted = As[DataV1, DataV2].into(original).right.get\n// converted.values might be List(1, 2, 3) depending on Set iteration order\n\nval roundTrip = As[DataV1, DataV2].from(converted).right.get\n// roundTrip.values == Set(1, 2, 3) - same elements, possibly different internal order\n```\n\n### Invalid As[A, B] Examples\n\n```scala\n// Invalid: Default values break round-trip guarantee\ncase class ProductV1(name: String, price: Double)\ncase class ProductV2(name: String, price: Double, taxable: Boolean = true)\n\n// COMPILE ERROR: Cannot derive As[ProductV1, ProductV2]\n// Reason: Default value for 'taxable' cannot be recovered in reverse direction\n// (We can't distinguish between explicitly set 'true' and default 'true')\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Matrix Dimensions\n\n1. **Type Combinations** (both `Into` and `As`)\n   - Primitive → Primitive (all coercion pairs, including narrowing)\n   - Product → Product (case classes)\n   - Product → Tuple\n   - Tuple → Product\n   - Tuple → Tuple\n   - Coproduct → Coproduct (sealed traits, enums)\n   - Collection[A] → Collection[B] (List, Vector, Set, Map, Option, Either, Array, Seq)\n   - Collection type conversions (List ↔ Vector ↔ Set ↔ Array ↔ Seq)\n   - Nested conversions\n   - Structural types\n\n2. **Disambiguation Scenarios**\n   - Unique types (names irrelevant)\n   - Matching names (types irrelevant with coercion)\n   - Duplicate types with name disambiguation\n   - Duplicate

fields\n   - Removing optional fields\n   - Type refinement (Int → Long, with narrowing validation)\n   - Adding default values (Scala 3)\n\n4. **Validation** (Scala 3 opaque types)\n   - Valid values pass through\n   - Invalid values produce SchemaError\n   - Multiple validation failures accumulate\n   - Nested validation in products\n   - Validation in coproduct cases\n   - Validation in collections\n   - Narrowing conversions (Long → Int with overflow check)\n\n5. **Validation** (Scala 2 ZIO Prelude newtypes)\n   - Newtype validation success\n   - Newtype validation failure\n   - Subtype validation with assertions\n   - Multiple newtype fields\n\n6. **Collection Type Conversions**\n   - List ↔ Vector\n   - List ↔ Array\n   - List ↔ Set (with duplicate handling)\n   - List ↔ Seq\n   - Vector ↔ Set\n   - Array ↔ Vector\n   - All combinations with element type coercion\n   - Nested collection type conversions\n\n7. **Runtime Validation** (for `As[A, B]`)\n   - Numeric narrowing validation\n   - Round-trip with valid narrowing\n   - Round-trip failure with overflow\n   - Collection conversions with duplicates\n   - Optional field round-trips\n\n8. **Error Cases**\n   - Ambiguous field mapping (compile error)\n   - Ambiguous case mapping (compile error)\n   - Default value in `As` (compile error)\n   - Runtime validation failures\n   - Type mismatch (compile error)\n   - Overflow in narrowing conversions\n\n9. **Edge Cases**\n   - Empty case classes\n   - Single-field case classes\n   - Case objects\n   - Sealed traits with case objects only\n   - Deeply nested structures (5+ levels)\n   - Large products (20+ fields)\n   - Large coproducts (20+ cases)\n   - Recursive types (e.g., `case class Tree(value: Int, children: List[Tree])`)\n   - Mutually recursive types\n\n### Test Organization\n\n```\nsrc/test/scala/\n  into/\n    products/\n      CaseClassToCaseClassSpec.scala\n      CaseClassToTupleSpec.scala\n      TupleToCaseClassSpec.scala\n

              "body": "## Overview\n\nAdd two related type classes for type-safe schema evolution:\n\n1. **`Into[A, B]`**: One-way conversion from `A` to `B` with runtime validation\n2. **`As[A, B]`**: Bidirectional conversion establishing a partial equivalence between `A` and `B`\n\nBoth type classes are automatically derived via macros that intelligently map fields using names, positions, and types, with support for validation, coercion, and schema evolution patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Type Class Definitions\n\n### Into[A, B] - One-Way Conversion\n\n```scala\ntrait Into[-A, +B] {\n  def into(input: A): Either[SchemaError, B]\n}\n```\n\n**Purpose**: Convert from source type `A` to target type `B`, potentially failing at runtime when validation constraints cannot be satisfied.\n\n**Use Cases**:\n- Migrating between schema versions\n- Converting between equivalent representations\n- Validating conversions with opaque types\n- Transforming external data into internal models\n\n### As[A, B] - Bidirectional Conversion\n\n```scala\ntrait As[A, B] {\n  def into(input: A): Either[SchemaError, B]\n  def from(input: B): Either[SchemaError, A]\n}\n```\n\n**Purpose**: Establish a partial equivalence between types `A` and `B` where conversion can fail in either direction due to runtime validation.\n\n**Use Cases**:\n- Isomorphic schema versions\n- Equivalent representations (e.g., case class ↔ tuple)\n- Reversible transformations with runtime validation\n- Round-trip serialization/deserialization\n\n**Relationship**: `As[A, B]` implies both `Into[A, B]` and `Into[B, A]` exist, but with the additional guarantee that both conversions use compatible mapping logic and can round-trip (subject to runtime validation).\n\n**Note**: `SchemaError` is composable, allowing multiple validation failures to be combined into a single error.\n\n---\n\n## Core Conversion Rules\n\n### Field Mapping Algorithm\n\nThe macro establishes field mappings using three attributes:\n1. **Field name** (identifier in source code)\n2. **Field position** (ordinal position in declaration)\n3. **Field type** (including coercible types)\n\n**Priority for disambiguation:**\n1. **Exact match**: Same name + same type\n2. **Name match with coercion**: Same name + coercible type\n3. **Unique type match**: Type appears only once in both source and target\n4. **Position + unique type**: Positional correspondence with unambiguous type\n5. **Fallback**: If no unambiguous mapping exists, derivation fails at compile-time\n\n### Mapping Examples\n\n#### Unambiguous by Unique Types\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int, active: Boolean)\ncase class User(username: String, yearsOld: Int, enabled: Boolean)\n\n// Success: Each type appears exactly once\n// Mapping: String→String, Int→Int, Boolean→Boolean\n```\n\n#### Unambiguous by Names\n```scala\ncase class Point(x: Int, y: Int)\ncase class Coord(y: Int, x: Int)\n\n// Success: Names uniquely identify despite reordering\n// Mapping: x→x, y→y\n```\n\n#### Ambiguous - Compile Failure\n```scala\ncase class Dimensions(width: Int, height: Int)\ncase class Measurements(first: Int, second: Int)\n\n// COMPILE ERROR: Cannot determine mapping\n// Both Int types, different names, ambiguous positional match\n```\n\n#### Disambiguation by Position (Tuples)\n```scala\ncase class RGB(r: Int, g: Int, b: Int)\ntype ColorTuple = (Int, Int, Int)\n\n// Success: Position disambiguates\n// Mapping: r→_1, g→_2, b→_3\n```\n\n---\n\n## Supported Conversions\n\n### 1. Product Types (Records)\n\n#### Case Class to Case Class\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(fullName: String, age: Int)\n\n// Success if 'name' is unique String in V1 and 'fullName' is unique String in V2\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", 30))\n```\n\n#### Case Class to Tuple\n```scala\ncase class Point(x: Double, y: Double)\n\nInto[Point, (Double, Double)].into(Point(1.0, 2.0))\n// => Right((1.0, 2.0))\n```\n\n#### Tuple to Case Class\n```scala\ncase class RGB(red: Int, green: Int, blue: Int)\n\nInto[(Int, Int, Int), RGB].into((255, 128, 64))\n// => Right(RGB(255, 128, 64))\n```\n\n#### Tuple to Tuple\n```scala\nInto[(Int, String), (Long, String)].into((42, \"hello\"))\n// => Right((42L, \"hello\"))\n```\n\n### 2. Coproduct Types (Sum Types)\n\n#### Sealed Trait to Sealed Trait (by name)\n```scala\nsealed trait Color\ncase object Red extends Color\ncase object Blue extends Color\n\nsealed trait Hue\ncase object Red extends Hue\ncase object Blue extends Hue\n\nInto[Color, Hue].into(Red)\n// => Right(Red)\n```\n\n#### Sealed Trait to Sealed Trait (by signature)\n```scala\nsealed trait EventV1\ncase class Created(id: String, ts: Long) extends EventV1\ncase class Deleted(id: String) extends EventV1\n\nsealed trait EventV2\ncase class Spawned(id: String, ts: Long) extends EventV2\ncase class Removed(id: String) extends EventV2\n\nInto[EventV1, EventV2].into(Created(\"abc\", 123L))\n// => Right(Spawned(\"abc\", 123L))\n// Matched by constructor signature (String, Long)\n```\n\n#### Enum to Enum (Scala 3)\n```scala\nenum Status:\n  case Active, Inactive, Suspended\n\nenum State:\n  case Active, Inactive, Suspended\n\nInto[Status, State].into(Status.Active)\n// => Right(State.Active)\n```\n\n#### ADT with Payload Conversion\n```scala\nsealed trait ResultV1\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends ResultV1\ncase class Failure(msg: String) extends ResultV1\n\nsealed trait ResultV2\ncase class Success(value: Long) extends ResultV2\ncase class Failure(msg: String) extends ResultV2\n\nInto[ResultV1, ResultV2].into(Success(42))\n// => Right(Success(42L))\n// Field type coercion within matched case\n```\n\n### 3.

Collection Type Conversions\n\n#### Between Standard Collection Types\n```scala\nInto[List[Int], Vector[Int]].into(List(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(Vector(1, 2, 3))\n\nInto[Vector[String], List[String]].into(Vector(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"))\n// => Right(List(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"))\n\nInto[Array[Int], List[Int]].into(Array(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(List(1, 2, 3))\n\nInto[List[Int], Array[Int]].into(List(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(Array(1, 2, 3))\n\nInto[Seq[Int], List[Int]].into(Seq(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(List(1, 2, 3))\n\nInto[List[Int], Seq[Int]].into(List(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(Seq(1, 2, 3))\n```\n\n#### Set Conversions (Order-Preserving Collections to Set)\n```scala\nInto[List[Int], Set[Int]].into(List(1, 2, 2, 3))\n// => Right(Set(1, 2, 3))\n// Note: Duplicates are removed\n\nInto[Vector[String], Set[String]].into(Vector(\"a\", \"b\", \"a\"))\n// => Right(Set(\"a\", \"b\"))\n```\n\n#### Set to Order-Preserving Collections\n```scala\nInto[Set[Int], List[Int]].into(Set(3, 1, 2))\n// => Right(List(1, 2, 3))\n// Note: Order is determined by Set's iteration order\n\nInto[Set[String], Vector[String]].into(Set(\"c\", \"a\", \"b\"))\n// => Right(Vector(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"))\n```\n\n#### Combined Element and Collection Type Conversion\n```scala\nInto[List[Int], Vector[Long]].into(List(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(Vector(1L, 2L, 3L))\n\nInto[Array[Short], List[Int]].into(Array(10.toShort, 20.toShort))\n// => Right(List(10, 20))\n\nInto[Set[Int], List[Long]].into(Set(1, 2, 3))\n// => Right(List(1L, 2L, 3L))\n```\n\n#### Nested Collection Type Conversions\n```scala\nInto[List[Vector[Int]], Vector[List[Long]]].into(List(Vector(1, 2), Vector(3, 4)))\n// => Right(Vector(List(1L, 2L), List(3L, 4L)))\n```\n\n### 5. Structural Types\n\n#### Structural Type Targets (Scala 3 with Selectable)\n```scala\ncase class Point(x: Int, y: Int)\ntype Coord = { def x: Int; def y: Int }\n\nInto[Point, Coord].into(Point(5, 10))\n// => Right(<structural instance with x=5, y=10>)\n```\n\n#### Structural Type Targets (Scala 2 with Dynamic)\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\ntype Record = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\nInto[Person, Record].into(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n// => Right(<dynamic instance with name=\"Alice\", age=30>)\n```\n\n#### Structural Type Sources\n```scala\ntype PersonLike = { def name: String; def age: Int }\ncase class User(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval personLike: PersonLike = ??? // some structural instance\nInto[PersonLike, User].into(personLike)\n// => Right(User(\"Alice\", 30))\n```\n\n### 6. Schema Evolution Patterns\n\n#### Adding Optional Fields\n```scala\ncase class UserV1(id: String, name: String)\ncase class UserV2(id: String, name: String, email: Option[String])\n\nInto[UserV1, UserV2].into(UserV1(\"123\", \"Alice\"))\n// => Right(UserV2(\"123\", \"Alice\", None))\n```\n\n#### Removing Optional Fields\n```scala\ncase class UserV2(id: String, name: String, email: Option[String])\ncase class UserV1(id: String, name: String)\n\nInto[UserV2, UserV1].into(UserV2(\"123\", \"Alice\", Some(\"alice@example.com\")))\n// => Right(UserV1(\"123\", \"Alice\"))\n// email field is dropped\n```\n\n#### Adding Required Fields with Defaults (Scala 3)\n```scala\ncase class ProductV1(name: String, price: Double)\ncase class ProductV2(name: String, price: Double, available: Boolean = true)\n\nInto[ProductV1, ProductV2].into(ProductV1(\"Widget\", 19.99))\n// => Right(ProductV2(\"Widget\", 19.99, true))\n```\n\n#### Field Reordering\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int, email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(email: String, name: String, age: Int)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30, \"alice@example.com\"))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"alice@example.com\", \"Alice\", 30))\n```\n\n#### Field Renaming (with unique types)\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(fullName: String, yearOfBirth: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, birthYear: Int)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice Smith\", 1990))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice Smith\", 1990))\n```\n\n#### Type Refinement\n```scala\ncase class ConfigV1(port: Int, timeout: Int)\ncase class ConfigV2(port: Int, timeout: Long)\n\nInto[ConfigV1, ConfigV2].into(ConfigV1(8080, 30))\n// => Right(ConfigV2(8080, 30L))\n```\n\n### 7. Nested Conversions\n\n#### Nested Products\n```scala\ncase class AddressV1(street: String, zip: Int)\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, address: AddressV1)\n\ncase class AddressV2(street: String, zip: Long)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, address: AddressV2)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(\n  PersonV1(\"Alice\", AddressV1(\"Main St\", 12345))\n)\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", AddressV2(\"Main St\", 12345L)))\n```\n\n#### Nested Coproducts\n```scala\nsealed trait Inner\ncase class A(x: Int) extends Inner\ncase class B(y: String) extends Inner\n\nsealed trait Outer\ncase class Container(inner: Inner, label: String) extends Outer\n\n// Similar target types with Long instead of Int\nsealed trait InnerV2\ncase class A(x: Long) extends InnerV2\ncase class B(y: String) extends InnerV2\n\nsealed trait OuterV2\ncase class Container(inner: InnerV2, label: String) extends OuterV2\n\nInto[Outer, OuterV2].into(Container(A(42), \"test\"))\n// => Right(Container(A(42L), \"test\"))\n```\n\n#### Collections of Complex Types\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Long)\n\nInto[List[PersonV1], List[PersonV2]].into(\n  List(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30), PersonV1(\"Bob\", 25))\n)\n// => Right(List(PersonV2(\"Alice\", 30L), PersonV2(\"Bob\", 25L)))\n```\n\n#### Nested Collections with Type Conversions\n```scala\ncase class DataV1(values: List[Vector[Int]])\ncase class DataV2(values: Vector[List[Long]])\n\nInto[DataV1, DataV2].into(\n  DataV1(List(Vector(1, 2), Vector(3, 4)))\n)\n// => Right(DataV2(Vector(List(1L, 2L), List(3L, 4L))))\n```\n\n---\n\n## Special Type Support\n\n### Opaque Types (Scala 3)\n\nOpaque types with validation are fully supported. The macro generates runtime validation calls.\n\n```scala\n// Definition with validation\nobject Domain:\n  opaque type Age = Int\n  object Age:\n    def apply(value: Int): Either[String, Age] =\n      if value >= 0 && value <= 150 then Right(value)\n      else Left(s\"Invalid age: $value\")\n    \n    def unsafe(value: Int): Age = value\n    \n    extension (age: Age)\n      def toInt: Int = age\n\n  opaque type Email = String\n  object Email:\n    def apply(value: String): Either[String, Email] =\n      if value.contains(\"@\") then Right(value)\n      else Left(s\"Invalid email: $value\")\n    \n    extension (email: Email)\n      def toString: String = email\n\nimport Domain._\n\n// Usage\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int, email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Age, email: Email)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30, \"alice@example.com\"))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", Age.unsafe(30), Email.unsafe(\"alice@example.com\")))\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", -5, \"alice@example.com\"))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Age validation failed: Invalid age: -5\"))\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30, \"invalid\"))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Email validation failed: Invalid email: invalid\"))\n```\n\n**Macro Behavior**:\n- Detects opaque type companion objects with `apply(underlying): Either[_, OpaqueType]` method\n- Generates validation calls for each opaque type field\n- Accumulates all validation errors using `SchemaError` composition\n- Falls back to direct conversion if no validation method exists\n\n### Newtype Libraries (Scala 2)\n\n#### ZIO Prelude Newtypes (Built-in Support)\n\nThe macro includes hardcoded support for ZIO Prelude newtypes without requiring a compile-time dependency.\n\n```scala\nimport zio.prelude._\n\n// Definition with validation\nobject Domain {\n  object Age extends Subtype[Int] {\n    override def assertion = assert {\n      Assertion.between(0, 150)\n    }\n  }\n  type Age = Age.Type\n\n  object Email extends Newtype[String] {\n    override def assertion = assert {\n      Assertion.matches(\".*@.*\")\n    }\n  }\n  type Email = Email.Type\n}\n\nimport Domain._\n\n// Usage\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int, email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Age, email: Email)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30, \"alice@example.com\"))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", Age(30), Email(\"alice@example.com\")))\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 200, \"invalid\"))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Validation failed: age: 200 is not between 0 and 150, email: invalid does not match .*@.*\"))\n```\n\n**Macro Detection** (no ZIO Prelude dependency required):\n```scala\n// The macro detects ZIO Prelude newtypes by checking:\n// 1. Type extends Newtype[A] or Subtype[A]\n// 2. Companion object exists\n// 3. Has apply/wrap method with validation\n\n// Low-level AST matching in Scala 2 macro:\ndef isZIONewtype(tpe: Type): Boolean = {\n  tpe.typeSymbol.fullName.startsWith(\"zio.prelude.Newtype\") ||\n  tpe.typeSymbol.fullName.startsWith(\"zio.prelude.Subtype\")\n}\n```\n\n#### Other Newtype Libraries\n\nFor other newtype libraries, users can provide explicit `Into` instances. The macro will use these instances when available.\n\n```scala\n// User-provided instance for their newtype library\nimplicit val stringToMyNewtype: Into[String, MyNewtype] = \n  new Into[String, MyNewtype] {\n    def into(s: String): Either[SchemaError, MyNewtype] =\n      MyNewtype.make(s).left.map(e => SchemaError(e.toString))\n  }\n\n// The macro will automatically use this instance\ncase class PersonV1(email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(email: MyNewtype)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"test@example.com\"))\n// Uses the user-provided instance automatically\n```\n\n### Validation Error Accumulation\n\nWhen multiple validations fail, all errors are accumulated using `SchemaError` composition:\n\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int, email: String)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Age, email: Email)\n\nInto[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"\", -5, \"invalid\"))\n// => Left(SchemaError(...)) // Combined error containing all validation failures\n```\n\n---\n\n## As[A, B] Additional Requirements\n\nFor `As[A, B]` to be derivable, the bidirectional conversion must be **compatible**:\n\n### Compatibility Rules\n\n1. **Field mappings must be consistent**: The same field correspondence in both directions\n2. **Coercions must be invertible with runtime validation**: \n   - ✅ `Int` ↔ `Long` is valid (narrowing validated at runtime)\n   - ✅ `Float` ↔ `Double` is valid (narrowing validated at runtime)\n   - ✅ All numeric coercions are valid with runtime checks\n3. **Optional fields**: \n   - ✅ Can add optional fields in one direction (becomes `None` in reverse)\n   - ✅ Can remove optional fields in one direction (value is dropped)\n4. **Default values**:\n   - ❌ Cannot use default arguments (breaks round-trip guarantee)\n5. **Collection types**:\n   - ✅ Can convert between different collection types\n   - ⚠️  Set → List → Set may not preserve original order\n   - ⚠️  List → Set → List loses duplicates\n\n### Valid As[A, B] Examples\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Same structure, different names\ncase class PersonV1(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(fullName: String, yearsOld: Int)\n\nAs[PersonV1, PersonV2].into(PersonV1(\"Alice\", 30))\n// => Right(PersonV2(\"Alice\", 30))\n\nAs[PersonV1, PersonV2].from(PersonV2(\"Bob\", 25))\n// => Right(PersonV1(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Case class ↔ Tuple\ncase class Point(x: Double, y: Double)\n\nAs[Point, (Double, Double)].into(Point(1.0, 2.0))\n// => Right((1.0, 2.0))\n\nAs[Point, (Double, Double)].from((3.0, 4.0))\n// => Right(Point(3.0, 4.0))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Numeric coercion with runtime validation\ncase class ConfigV1(timeout: Int)\ncase class ConfigV2(timeout: Long)\n\nAs[ConfigV1, ConfigV2].into(ConfigV1(30))\n// => Right(ConfigV2(30L))\n\nAs[ConfigV1, ConfigV2].from(ConfigV2(30L))\n// => Right(ConfigV1(30))\n\nAs[ConfigV1, ConfigV2].from(ConfigV2(3000000000L))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Value 3000000000 exceeds Int.MaxValue\"))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Opaque types (reversible via unwrap)\ncase class PersonRaw(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonValidated(name: String, age: Age)\n\nAs[PersonRaw, PersonValidated].into(PersonRaw(\"Alice\", 30))\n// => Right(PersonValidated(\"Alice\", Age.unsafe(30)))\n\nAs[PersonRaw, PersonValidated].from(PersonValidated(\"Bob\", Age.unsafe(25)))\n// => Right(PersonRaw(\"Bob\", 25))\n\nAs[PersonRaw, PersonValidated].into(PersonRaw(\"Charlie\", -5))\n// => Left(SchemaError(\"Age validation failed: Invalid age: -5\"))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Collection type conversions\ncase class DataV1(items: List[Int])\ncase class DataV2(items: Vector[Int])\n\nAs[DataV1, DataV2].into(DataV1(List(1, 2, 3)))\n// => Right(DataV2(Vector(1, 2, 3)))\n\nAs[DataV1, DataV2].from(DataV2(Vector(4, 5, 6)))\n// => Right(DataV1(List(4, 5, 6)))\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid: Optional field in one direction\ncase class UserV1(id: String, name: String)\ncase class UserV2(id: String, name: String, email: Option[String])\n\nAs[UserV1, UserV2].into(UserV1(\"123\", \"Alice\"))\n// => Right(UserV2(\"123\", \"Alice\", None))\n\nAs[UserV1, UserV2].from(UserV2(\"456\", \"Bob\", Some(\"bob@example.com\")))\n// => Right(UserV1(\"456\", \"Bob\"))\n// email is dropped in reverse direction\n```\n\n### Non-Ideal As[A, B] Examples (Valid but Lossy)\n\n```scala\n// Valid but lossy: List with duplicates → Set → List\ncase class DataV1(values: List[Int])\ncase class DataV2(values: Set[Int])\n\nAs[DataV1, DataV2].into(DataV1(List(1, 2, 2, 3)))\n// => Right(DataV2(Set(1, 2, 3)))\n\nAs[DataV1, DataV2].from(DataV2(Set(1, 2, 3)))\n// => Right(DataV1(List(1, 2, 3)))\n// Original duplicates are lost, but conversion is valid\n```\n\n```scala\n// Valid but lossy: Set → List → Set (order may change)\ncase class DataV1(values: Set[Int])\ncase class DataV2(values: List[Int])\n\nval original = DataV1(Set(3, 1, 2))\nval converted = As[DataV1, DataV2].into(original).right.get\n// converted.values might be List(1, 2, 3) depending on Set iteration order\n\nval roundTrip = As[DataV1, DataV2].from(converted).right.get\n// roundTrip.values == Set(1, 2, 3) - same elements, possibly different internal order\n```\n\n### Invalid As[A, B] Examples\n\n```scala\n// Invalid: Default values break round-trip guarantee\ncase class ProductV1(name: String, price: Double)\ncase class ProductV2(name: String, price: Double, taxable: Boolean = true)\n\n// COMPILE ERROR: Cannot derive As[ProductV1, ProductV2]\n// Reason: Default value for 'taxable' cannot be recovered in reverse direction\n// (We can't distinguish between explicitly set 'true' and default 'true')\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Matrix Dimensions\n\n1. **Type Combinations** (both `Into` and `As`)\n   - Primitive → Primitive (all coercion pairs, including narrowing)\n   - Product → Product (case classes)\n   - Product → Tuple\n   - Tuple → Product\n   - Tuple → Tuple\n   - Coproduct → Coproduct (sealed traits, enums)\n   - Collection[A] → Collection[B] (List, Vector, Set, Map, Option, Either, Array, Seq)\n   - Collection type conversions (List ↔ Vector ↔ Set ↔ Array ↔ Seq)\n   - Nested conversions\n   - Structural types\n\n2. **Disambiguation Scenarios**\n   - Unique types (names irrelevant)\n   - Matching names (types irrelevant with coercion)\n   - Duplicate types with name disambiguation\n   - Duplicate types with position disambiguation\n   - Ambiguous cases (must fail at compile-time)\n\n3. **Schema Evolution**\n   - Field reordering\n   - Field renaming (with unique types)\n   - Adding optional fields\n   - Removing optional fields\n   - Type refinement (Int → Long, with narrowing validation)\n   - Adding default values (Scala 3)\n\n4. **Validation** (Scala 3 opaque types)\n   - Valid values pass through\n   - Invalid values produce SchemaError\n   - Multiple validation failures accumulate\n   - Nested validation in products\n   - Validation in coproduct cases\n   - Validation in collections\n   - Narrowing conversions (Long → Int with overflow check)\n\n5. **Validation** (Scala 2 ZIO Prelude newtypes)\n   - Newtype validation success\n   - Newtype validation failure\n   - Subtype validation with assertions\n   - Multiple newtype fields\n\n6. **Collection Type Conversions**\n   - List ↔ Vector\n   - List ↔ Array\n   - List ↔ Set (with duplicate handling)\n   - List ↔ Seq\n   - Vector ↔ Set\n   - Array ↔ Vector\n   - All combinations with element type coercion\n   - Nested collection type conversions\n\n7. **Runtime Validation** (for `As[A, B]`)\n   - Numeric narrowing validation\n   - Round-trip with valid narrowing\n   - Round-trip failure with overflow\n   - Collection conversions with duplicates\n   - Optional field round-trips\n\n8. **Error Cases**\n   - Ambiguous field mapping (compile error)\n   - Ambiguous case mapping (compile error)\n   - Default value in `As` (compile error)\n   - Runtime validation failures\n   - Type mismatch (compile error)\n   - Overflow in narrowing conversions\n\n9. **Edge Cases**\n   - Empty case classes\n   - Single-field case classes\n   - Case objects\n   - Sealed traits with case objects only\n   - Deeply nested structures (5+ levels)\n   - Large products (20+ fields)\n   - Large coproducts (20+ cases)\n   - Recursive types (e.g., `case class Tree(value: Int, children: List[Tree])`)\n   - Mutually recursive types\n\n### Test Organization\n\n```\nsrc/test/scala/\n  into/\n    products/\n      CaseClassToCaseClassSpec.scala\n      CaseClassToTupleSpec.scala\n      TupleToCaseClassSpec.scala\n

This allows for duck-typed schema validation and conversion between nominal and structural representations.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Direct Structural Schema Derivation\n\nSchemas can be derived directly for structural types:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 3\ntype Person = { def name: String; def age: Int }\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\n\n// Scala 2\ntype Person = { def name: String; def age: Int }\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\n```\n\n**Note**: Both Scala 2 and Scala 3 use `def` for uniformity, even though Scala 3 supports `val` in structural types.\n\n**Implementation**: Schemas have bindings, which allow construction / deconstruction of values. Values for structural types are backed by:\n- **Scala 3**: `Selectable` \n- **Scala 2**: `Dynamic`\n\n### Nominal to Structural Conversion\n\nConvert nominal type schemas to their structural equivalents:\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Get the structural schema corresponding to Person's shape\nval structuralSchema: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Schema.derived[Person].structural\n```\n\n### Schema API Extension\n\n```scala\ncase class Schema[A](/* existing fields */) {\n  /**\n   * Convert this schema to a structural type schema.\n   * \n   * The structural type represents the \"shape\" of A without its nominal identity.\n   * This enables duck typing and structural validation.\n   * \n   * @param toStructural Macro-generated conversion to structural representation\n   * @return Schema for the structural type corresponding to A\n   */\n  def structural(implicit toStructural: ToStructural[A]): Schema[toStructural.StructuralType] = \n    toStructural.apply(this)\n}\n\n/**\n * Type class for converting nominal schemas to structural schemas.\n * Generated by macro for all supported types.

Simple Product Types\n\n#### Case Class to Structural\n\n```scala\n// Both Scala 2 and Scala 3\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Original nominal schema\nval nominalSchema: Schema[Person] = Schema.derived[Person]\n\n// Convert to structural\nval structuralSchema: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  nominalSchema.structural\n\n// Direct structural derivation (equivalent)\nval directStructural: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Schema.derived[{ def name: String; def age: Int }]\n```\n\n### 2. Nested Structures\n\n```scala\ncase class Address(street: String, city: String, zip: Int)\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int, address: Address)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ \n//   def name: String\n//   def age: Int\n//   def address: { def street: String; def city: String; def zip: Int }\n// }]\n```\n\n### 3. Collections and Options\n\n```scala\ncase class Team(name: String, members: List[String], leader: Option[String])\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Team].structural\n// Type: Schema[{\n//   def name: String\n//   def members: List[String]\n//   def leader: Option[String]\n// }]\n```\n\n### 4. Tuples to Structural\n\n```scala\n// Tuples can be converted to structural types\nval tupleSchema: Schema[(String, Int, Boolean)] = Schema.derived[(String, Int, Boolean)]\n\nval structuralSchema = tupleSchema.structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def _1: String; def _2: Int; def _3: Boolean }]\n```\n\n### 5. Sum Types (Sealed Traits) - Scala 3 Only\n\nSealed traits become union types of structural representations, with tag information stored at the type level:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 3 only\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Result].structural\n// Type: Schema[\n//   { type Tag = \"Success\"; def value: Int } | { type Tag = \"Failure\"; def error: String }\n// ]\n```\n\n**Note**: Sum type to structural conversion is **not supported in Scala 2** because it requires union types. Attempting to call `.structural` on a sealed trait schema in Scala 2 will result in a compile-time error.\n\n### 6. Enums (Scala 3 Only)\n\n```scala\nenum Status:\n  case Active, Inactive, Suspended\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Status].structural\n// Type: Schema[{type Tag = \"Active\"} | {type Tag = \"Inactive\"} | {type Tag = \"Suspended\"}]\n```\n\n### 7. Opaque Types (Scala 3)\n\n```scala\nopaque type UserId = String\nobject UserId:\n  def apply(value: String): Either[String, UserId] = \n    if value.nonEmpty then Right(value) else Left(\"Empty user ID\")\n\ncase class User(id: UserId, name: String)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[User].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def id: String; def name: String }]\n// Opaque type is unwrapped to its underlying type\n```\n\n### 8. Bidirectional Conversion\n\nStructural schemas work seamlessly with `Into`/`As` (if this ticket is implemented **after** that ticket):\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n\n// Create structural value (Scala 3)\nval structuralPerson = new Selectable {\n  def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n    case \"name\" => \"Alice\"\n    case \"age\" => 30\n  }\n}\n\n// Convert structural to nominal using Into\nval person: Either[SchemaError, Person] = \n  Into[{ def name: String; def age: Int }, Person].into(structuralPerson)\n// => Right(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n\n// Convert nominal to structural\nval backToStructural: Either[SchemaError, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Into[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }].into(Person(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n### 9. Empty and Single-Field Products\n\n```scala\n// Empty case class\ncase class Empty()\nval emptyStructural = Schema.derived[Empty].structural\n// Type: Schema[{}]\n\n// Single field\ncase class Id(value: String)\nval idStructural = Schema.derived[Id].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def value: String }]\n```\n\n### 10. Large Products\n\n```scala\ncase class LargeRecord(\n  f1: String, f2: Int, f3: Boolean, f4: Double, f5: Long,\n  f6: String, f7: Int, f8: Boolean, f9: Double, f10: Long,\n  f11: String, f12: Int, f13: Boolean, f14: Double, f15: Long,\n  f16: String, f17: Int, f18: Boolean, f19: Double, f20: Long,\n  f21: String\n)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[LargeRecord].structural\n// Type: Schema[{\n//   def f1: String; def f2: Int; def f3: Boolean; ...\n//   def f21: String\n// }]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Type Name Handling\n\n### Current Limitation\n\nSchemas currently use `TypeName[A]` to identify types. Structural types don't have meaningful nominal type names, which creates a mismatch.\n\n### Temporary Solution\n\nUntil `TypeName[A]` is replaced with `TypeId[A]` (see issue #471), structural schemas will use a normalized string representation of the structural type as a fake type name:\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\nschema.typeName // => TypeName for \"Person\"\n\nval structural = schema.structural\nstructural.typeName // => TypeName for \"{age:Int,name:String}\"\n// Normalized: fields sorted alphabetically, types fully qualified\n```\n\n### Normalization Rules\n\n1. **Field ordering**: Alphabetical by field name\n2. **Type qualification**: Use simple names for primitives and standard library types\n3. **Whitespace**: No whitespace in generated names\n4. **Collections**: Standard notation (e.g., `List[Int]`)\n5. **Options**: Explicit `Option[T]` notation\n6. **Nested structures**: Recursive application of rules\n7. **Deterministic**: Same structure always produces same normalized name\n\n### Examples\n\n```scala\n// Simple product\ncase class Point(x: Int, y: Int)\nSchema.derived[Point].structural.typeName \n// => \"{x:Int,y:Int}\"\n\n// Nested product\ncase class Address(street: String, zip: Int)\ncase class Person(name: String, address: Address)\nSchema.derived[Person].structural.typeName\n// => \"{address:{street:String,zip:Int},name:String}\"\n\n// With collections\ncase class Team(name: String, members: List[String])\nSchema.derived[Team].structural.typeName\n// => \"{members:List[String],name:String}\"\n\n// Union type (Scala 3)\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\nSchema.derived[Result].structural.typeName\n// => \"{error:String}|{value:Int}\"\n```\n\n### Future: TypeId[A]\n\nThe upcoming `TypeId[A]` replacement will properly handle structural types by representing them by their structure rather than a string-based hack. See issue #471 for details.\n\n---\n\n## Limitations and Edge Cases\n\n### 1. Generic Types\n\n**Behavior depends on existing Schema derivation support for generic types.**\n\nIf `Schema.derived[Container[Int]]` already works, then structural conversion should work:\n\n```scala\ncase class Container[T](value: T)\n\n// If this works:\nval schema = Schema.derived[Container[Int]]\n\n// Then this should work:\nval structural = schema.structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def value: Int }]\n```\n\nIf generic type derivation is not currently supported, this ticket **does not require implementing it**. The macro should produce a clear compile-time error for unsupported generic types.\n\n### 2. Recursive Types\n\nRecursive types will **fail at compile-time** because Scala does not support infinite types:\n\n```scala\ncase class Tree(value: Int, children: List[Tree])\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time:\nval structural = Schema.derived[Tree].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate infinite structural type\n\n// The structural type would need to be:\n// { def value: Int; def children: List[{ def value: Int; def children: List[...] }] }\n// which is infinite and unsupported\n```\n\nThe macro must detect recursive types and produce a helpful error message:\n\n```\nCompile error: Cannot generate structural type for recursive type Tree.\nStructural types cannot represent recursive structures.\n```\n\n### 3. Mutually Recursive Types\n\nSimilarly, mutually recursive types are unsupported:\n\n```scala\ncase class Node(id: Int, edges: List[Edge])\ncase class Edge(from: Int, to: Node)\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time:\nval nodeStructural = Schema.derived[Node].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate structural type for mutually recursive types\n```\n\n### 4. Sum Types in Scala 2\n\nSealed traits and sum types **cannot be converted to structural types in Scala 2** because they require union types:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 2\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time in Scala 2:\nval structural = Schema.derived[Result].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate structural type for sum types in Scala 2.\n// Union types are required, which are only available in Scala 3.\n```\n\nThe macro must detect sum types in Scala 2 and produce a clear error.\n\n### 5. Case Objects\n\nCase objects become empty structural types:\n\n```scala\ncase object Singleton\n\nval structural = Schema.derived[Singleton.type].structural\n// Type: Schema[{}]\n```\n\nFor sum types with case objects (Scala 3):\n\n```scala\nsealed trait Status\ncase object Active extends Status\ncase object Inactive extends Status\n\nval structural = Schema.derived[Status].structural\n// Type: Schema[{} | {}]\n// Not particularly useful, but valid\n```\n\n### 6. Structural Types as Source\n\nDeriving schemas directly for structural types is supported:\n\n```scala\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\nval schema = Schema.derived[PersonStructure]\n// Should work if structural type derivation is implemented\n```\n\nThe schema's bindings will use `Selectable` (Scala 3) or `Dynamic` (Scala 2) to construct and deconstruct values.\n\n---\n\n## Integration with Into/As\n\nStructural schemas compose naturally with `Into`/`As` conversions.\n\n### Nominal → Structural\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Auto-derived conversion\nval nominalToStructural: Into[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Into.derived\n\nval person = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\nval structural = nominalToStructural.into(person)\n// => Right(<Selectable/Dynamic instance>)\n```\n\n### Structural → Nominal\n\n```scala\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Auto-derived conversion\nval structuralToNominal: Into[PersonStructure, Person] = \n  Into.derived\n\nval structural: PersonStructure = new Selectable {\n  def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n    case \"name\" => \"Bob\"\n    case \"age\" => 25\n  }\n}\n\nval person = structuralToNominal.into(structural)\n// => Right(Person(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n### Bidirectional (As)\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Bidirectional conversion\nval personAs: As[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  As.derived\n\n// Nominal → Structural\nval structural = personAs.into(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n\n// Structural → Nominal\nval nominal = structural.flatMap(personAs.from)\n// Round-trip successful\n```\n\n### Schema-Guided Conversion\n\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(firstName: String, lastName: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Use structural type as intermediary\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\n// Step 1: Transform V1 to structural (custom logic)\nval v1ToStructural: Into[PersonV1, PersonStructure] = \n  new Into[PersonV1, PersonStructure] {\n    def into(v1: PersonV1): Either[SchemaError, PersonStructure] = {\n      Right(new Selectable {\n        def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n          case \"name\" => s\"${v1.firstName} ${v1.lastName}\"\n          case \"age\" => v1.age\n        }\n      })\n    }\n  }\n\n// Step 2: Auto-convert structural to V2\nval structuralToV2: Into[PersonStructure, PersonV2] = Into.derived\n\n// Composed migration\ndef migrate(v1: PersonV1): Either[SchemaError, PersonV2] = {\n  v1ToStructural.into(v1).flatMap(structuralToV2.into)\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Matrix\n\n1. **Direct Structural Derivation**\n   - Simple products (case classes)\n   - Nested products\n   - Collections (List, Vector, Set, Map, Option, Either)\n   - Tuples (2-22 elements)\n   - Empty case classes\n   - Single-field case classes\n   - Large products (20+ fields)\n   - Case objects\n\n2. **Nominal to Structural Conversion**\n   - Case class → structural\n   - Tuple → structural\n   - Nested case classes → nested structural\n   - Case class with collections → structural with collections\n   - Empty case class → empty structural\n\n3. **Sum Types (Scala 3 Only)**\n   - Sealed trait → union type structural\n   - Sealed trait with case objects\n   - Enum → union type structural\n   - Nested sum types\n\n4. **Type Name Generation**\n   - Simple product normalized name\n   - Nested product normalized name\n   - Name determinism (same structure = same name)\n   - Alphabetical field ordering in names\n   - Union type names (Scala 3)\n\n5. **Selectable/Dynamic Implementation**\n   - Scala 3 Selectable field access\n   - Scala 2 Dynamic field access\n   - Field access correctness\n   - Missing field behavior\n   - Extra field behavior\n\n6. **Integration with Into/As**\n   - Nominal → Structural via Into\n   - Structural → Nominal via Into\n   - Round-trip via As\n   - Composed conversions with structural intermediary\n\n7. **Error Cases (Compile-Time)**\n   - Recursive types produce error\n   - Mutually recursive types produce error\n   - Sum types in Scala 2 produce error\n   - Unsupported types produce helpful errors\n\n8. **Generic Types** (if supported by existing Schema derivation)\n   - Fully applied generic → structural\n   - Generic with nested structural fields\n\n### Scala 2 vs Scala 3 Test Separation\n\n```\nsrc/test/scala/\n  structural/\n    common/\n      SimpleProductSpec.scala\n      NestedProductSpec.scala\n      CollectionsSpec.scala\n      TuplesSpec.scala\n      EmptyProductSpec.scala\n      SingleFieldSpec.scala\n      LargeProductSpec.scala\n      TypeNameNormalizationSpec.scala\n      IntoIntegrationSpec.scala\n      AsIntegrationSpec.scala\n      \n    scala3/\n      UnionTypesSpec.scala\n      SealedTraitToUnionSpec.scala\n      EnumToUnionSpec.scala\n      SelectableImplementationSpec.scala\n      \n    scala2/\n      DynamicImplementationSpec.scala\n      SumTypeErrorSpec.scala (verifies compile error)\n      \n    errors/\n      RecursiveTypeErrorSpec.scala\n      MutualRecursionErrorSpec.scala\n      UnsupportedTypeErrorSpec.scala\n```\n\n### Test Examples\n\n```scala\n// Test: Simple product to structural\ntest(\"case class converts to structural schema\") {\n  case class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n  \n  val structural = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n  \n  // Type check (this is a compile-time test)\n  val _: Schema[{ def name: String;

This allows for duck-typed schema validation and conversion between nominal and structural representations.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Direct Structural Schema Derivation\n\nSchemas can be derived directly for structural types:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 3\ntype Person = { def name: String; def age: Int }\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\n\n// Scala 2\ntype Person = { def name: String; def age: Int }\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\n```\n\n**Note**: Both Scala 2 and Scala 3 use `def` for uniformity, even though Scala 3 supports `val` in structural types.\n\n**Implementation**: Schemas have bindings, which allow construction / deconstruction of values. Values for structural types are backed by:\n- **Scala 3**: `Selectable` \n- **Scala 2**: `Dynamic`\n\n### Nominal to Structural Conversion\n\nConvert nominal type schemas to their structural equivalents:\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Get the structural schema corresponding to Person's shape\nval structuralSchema: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Schema.derived[Person].structural\n```\n\n### Schema API Extension\n\n```scala\ncase class Schema[A](/* existing fields */) {\n  /**\n   * Convert this schema to a structural type schema.\n   * \n   * The structural type represents the \"shape\" of A without its nominal identity.\n   * This enables duck typing and structural validation.\n   * \n   * @param toStructural Macro-generated conversion to structural representation\n   * @return Schema for the structural type corresponding to A\n   */\n  def structural(implicit toStructural: ToStructural[A]): Schema[toStructural.StructuralType] = \n    toStructural.apply(this)\n}\n\n/**\n * Type class for converting nominal schemas to structural schemas.\n * Generated by macro for all supported types. Macro fails if a structural\n * type cannot be generated.\n *\n * NOTE: This approach has to be tested to yield inferrable types, and revised\n * if necessary.

Simple Product Types\n\n#### Case Class to Structural\n\n```scala\n// Both Scala 2 and Scala 3\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Original nominal schema\nval nominalSchema: Schema[Person] = Schema.derived[Person]\n\n// Convert to structural\nval structuralSchema: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  nominalSchema.structural\n\n// Direct structural derivation (equivalent)\nval directStructural: Schema[{ def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Schema.derived[{ def name: String; def age: Int }]\n```\n\n### 2. Nested Structures\n\n```scala\ncase class Address(street: String, city: String, zip: Int)\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int, address: Address)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ \n//   def name: String\n//   def age: Int\n//   def address: { def street: String; def city: String; def zip: Int }\n// }]\n```\n\n### 3. Collections and Options\n\n```scala\ncase class Team(name: String, members: List[String], leader: Option[String])\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Team].structural\n// Type: Schema[{\n//   def name: String\n//   def members: List[String]\n//   def leader: Option[String]\n// }]\n```\n\n### 4. Tuples to Structural\n\n```scala\n// Tuples can be converted to structural types\nval tupleSchema: Schema[(String, Int, Boolean)] = Schema.derived[(String, Int, Boolean)]\n\nval structuralSchema = tupleSchema.structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def _1: String; def _2: Int; def _3: Boolean }]\n```\n\n### 5. Sum Types (Sealed Traits) - Scala 3 Only\n\nSealed traits become union types of structural representations, with tag information stored at the type level:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 3 only\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Result].structural\n// Type: Schema[\n//   { type Tag = \"Success\"; def value: Int } | { type Tag = \"Failure\"; def error: String }\n// ]\n```\n\n**Note**: Sum type to structural conversion is **not supported in Scala 2** because it requires union types. Attempting to call `.structural` on a sealed trait schema in Scala 2 will result in a compile-time error.\n\n### 6. Enums (Scala 3 Only)\n\n```scala\nenum Status:\n  case Active, Inactive, Suspended\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Status].structural\n// Type: Schema[{type Tag = \"Active\"} | {type Tag = \"Inactive\"} | {type Tag = \"Suspended\"}]\n```\n\n### 7. Opaque Types (Scala 3)\n\n```scala\nopaque type UserId = String\nobject UserId:\n  def apply(value: String): Either[String, UserId] = \n    if value.nonEmpty then Right(value) else Left(\"Empty user ID\")\n\ncase class User(id: UserId, name: String)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[User].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def id: String; def name: String }]\n// Opaque type is unwrapped to its underlying type\n```\n\n### 8. Bidirectional Conversion\n\nStructural schemas work seamlessly with `Into`/`As` (if this ticket is implemented **after** that ticket):\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n\n// Create structural value (Scala 3)\nval structuralPerson = new Selectable {\n  def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n    case \"name\" => \"Alice\"\n    case \"age\" => 30\n  }\n}\n\n// Convert structural to nominal using Into\nval person: Either[SchemaError, Person] = \n  Into[{ def name: String; def age: Int }, Person].into(structuralPerson)\n// => Right(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n\n// Convert nominal to structural\nval backToStructural: Either[SchemaError, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Into[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }].into(Person(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n### 9. Empty and Single-Field Products\n\n```scala\n// Empty case class\ncase class Empty()\nval emptyStructural = Schema.derived[Empty].structural\n// Type: Schema[{}]\n\n// Single field\ncase class Id(value: String)\nval idStructural = Schema.derived[Id].structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def value: String }]\n```\n\n### 10. Large Products\n\n```scala\ncase class LargeRecord(\n  f1: String, f2: Int, f3: Boolean, f4: Double, f5: Long,\n  f6: String, f7: Int, f8: Boolean, f9: Double, f10: Long,\n  f11: String, f12: Int, f13: Boolean, f14: Double, f15: Long,\n  f16: String, f17: Int, f18: Boolean, f19: Double, f20: Long,\n  f21: String\n)\n\nval structuralSchema = Schema.derived[LargeRecord].structural\n// Type: Schema[{\n//   def f1: String; def f2: Int; def f3: Boolean; ...\n//   def f21: String\n// }]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Type Name Handling\n\n### Current Limitation\n\nSchemas currently use `TypeName[A]` to identify types. Structural types don't have meaningful nominal type names, which creates a mismatch.\n\n### Temporary Solution\n\nUntil `TypeName[A]` is replaced with `TypeId[A]` (see issue #471), structural schemas will use a normalized string representation of the structural type as a fake type name:\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\nval schema = Schema.derived[Person]\nschema.typeName // => TypeName for \"Person\"\n\nval structural = schema.structural\nstructural.typeName // => TypeName for \"{age:Int,name:String}\"\n// Normalized: fields sorted alphabetically, types fully qualified\n```\n\n### Normalization Rules\n\n1. **Field ordering**: Alphabetical by field name\n2. **Type qualification**: Use simple names for primitives and standard library types\n3. **Whitespace**: No whitespace in generated names\n4. **Collections**: Standard notation (e.g., `List[Int]`)\n5. **Options**: Explicit `Option[T]` notation\n6. **Nested structures**: Recursive application of rules\n7. **Deterministic**: Same structure always produces same normalized name\n\n### Examples\n\n```scala\n// Simple product\ncase class Point(x: Int, y: Int)\nSchema.derived[Point].structural.typeName \n// => \"{x:Int,y:Int}\"\n\n// Nested product\ncase class Address(street: String, zip: Int)\ncase class Person(name: String, address: Address)\nSchema.derived[Person].structural.typeName\n// => \"{address:{street:String,zip:Int},name:String}\"\n\n// With collections\ncase class Team(name: String, members: List[String])\nSchema.derived[Team].structural.typeName\n// => \"{members:List[String],name:String}\"\n\n// Union type (Scala 3)\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\nSchema.derived[Result].structural.typeName\n// => \"{error:String}|{value:Int}\"\n```\n\n### Future: TypeId[A]\n\nThe upcoming `TypeId[A]` replacement will properly handle structural types by representing them by their structure rather than a string-based hack. See issue #471 for details.\n\n---\n\n## Limitations and Edge Cases\n\n### 1. Generic Types\n\n**Behavior depends on existing Schema derivation support for generic types.**\n\nIf `Schema.derived[Container[Int]]` already works, then structural conversion should work:\n\n```scala\ncase class Container[T](value: T)\n\n// If this works:\nval schema = Schema.derived[Container[Int]]\n\n// Then this should work:\nval structural = schema.structural\n// Type: Schema[{ def value: Int }]\n```\n\nIf generic type derivation is not currently supported, this ticket **does not require implementing it**. The macro should produce a clear compile-time error for unsupported generic types.\n\n### 2. Recursive Types\n\nRecursive types will **fail at compile-time** because Scala does not support infinite types:\n\n```scala\ncase class Tree(value: Int, children: List[Tree])\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time:\nval structural = Schema.derived[Tree].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate infinite structural type\n\n// The structural type would need to be:\n// { def value: Int; def children: List[{ def value: Int; def children: List[...] }] }\n// which is infinite and unsupported\n```\n\nThe macro must detect recursive types and produce a helpful error message:\n\n```\nCompile error: Cannot generate structural type for recursive type Tree.\nStructural types cannot represent recursive structures.\n```\n\n### 3. Mutually Recursive Types\n\nSimilarly, mutually recursive types are unsupported:\n\n```scala\ncase class Node(id: Int, edges: List[Edge])\ncase class Edge(from: Int, to: Node)\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time:\nval nodeStructural = Schema.derived[Node].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate structural type for mutually recursive types\n```\n\n### 4. Sum Types in Scala 2\n\nSealed traits and sum types **cannot be converted to structural types in Scala 2** because they require union types:\n\n```scala\n// Scala 2\nsealed trait Result\ncase class Success(value: Int) extends Result\ncase class Failure(error: String) extends Result\n\n// This will FAIL at compile-time in Scala 2:\nval structural = Schema.derived[Result].structural\n// Compile error: Cannot generate structural type for sum types in Scala 2.\n// Union types are required, which are only available in Scala 3.\n```\n\nThe macro must detect sum types in Scala 2 and produce a clear error.\n\n### 5. Case Objects\n\nCase objects become empty structural types:\n\n```scala\ncase object Singleton\n\nval structural = Schema.derived[Singleton.type].structural\n// Type: Schema[{}]\n```\n\nFor sum types with case objects (Scala 3):\n\n```scala\nsealed trait Status\ncase object Active extends Status\ncase object Inactive extends Status\n\nval structural = Schema.derived[Status].structural\n// Type: Schema[{} | {}]\n// Not particularly useful, but valid\n```\n\n### 6. Structural Types as Source\n\nDeriving schemas directly for structural types is supported:\n\n```scala\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\nval schema = Schema.derived[PersonStructure]\n// Should work if structural type derivation is implemented\n```\n\nThe schema's bindings will use `Selectable` (Scala 3) or `Dynamic` (Scala 2) to construct and deconstruct values.\n\n---\n\n## Integration with Into/As\n\nStructural schemas compose naturally with `Into`/`As` conversions.\n\n### Nominal → Structural\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Auto-derived conversion\nval nominalToStructural: Into[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  Into.derived\n\nval person = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\nval structural = nominalToStructural.into(person)\n// => Right(<Selectable/Dynamic instance>)\n```\n\n### Structural → Nominal\n\n```scala\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Auto-derived conversion\nval structuralToNominal: Into[PersonStructure, Person] = \n  Into.derived\n\nval structural: PersonStructure = new Selectable {\n  def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n    case \"name\" => \"Bob\"\n    case \"age\" => 25\n  }\n}\n\nval person = structuralToNominal.into(structural)\n// => Right(Person(\"Bob\", 25))\n```\n\n### Bidirectional (As)\n\n```scala\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Bidirectional conversion\nval personAs: As[Person, { def name: String; def age: Int }] = \n  As.derived\n\n// Nominal → Structural\nval structural = personAs.into(Person(\"Alice\", 30))\n\n// Structural → Nominal\nval nominal = structural.flatMap(personAs.from)\n// Round-trip successful\n```\n\n### Schema-Guided Conversion\n\n```scala\ncase class PersonV1(firstName: String, lastName: String, age: Int)\ncase class PersonV2(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Use structural type as intermediary\ntype PersonStructure = { def name: String; def age: Int }\n\n// Step 1: Transform V1 to structural (custom logic)\nval v1ToStructural: Into[PersonV1, PersonStructure] = \n  new Into[PersonV1, PersonStructure] {\n    def into(v1: PersonV1): Either[SchemaError, PersonStructure] = {\n      Right(new Selectable {\n        def selectDynamic(field: String): Any = field match {\n          case \"name\" => s\"${v1.firstName} ${v1.lastName}\"\n          case \"age\" => v1.age\n        }\n      })\n    }\n  }\n\n// Step 2: Auto-convert structural to V2\nval structuralToV2: Into[PersonStructure, PersonV2] = Into.derived\n\n// Composed migration\ndef migrate(v1: PersonV1): Either[SchemaError, PersonV2] = {\n  v1ToStructural.into(v1).flatMap(structuralToV2.into)\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Matrix\n\n1. **Direct Structural Derivation**\n   - Simple products (case classes)\n   - Nested products\n   - Collections (List, Vector, Set, Map, Option, Either)\n   - Tuples (2-22 elements)\n   - Empty case classes\n   - Single-field case classes\n   - Large products (20+ fields)\n   - Case objects\n\n2. **Nominal to Structural Conversion**\n   - Case class → structural\n   - Tuple → structural\n   - Nested case classes → nested structural\n   - Case class with collections → structural with collections\n   - Empty case class → empty structural\n\n3. **Sum Types (Scala 3 Only)**\n   - Sealed trait → union type structural\n   - Sealed trait with case objects\n   - Enum → union type structural\n   - Nested sum types\n\n4. **Type Name Generation**\n   - Simple product normalized name\n   - Nested product normalized name\n   - Name determinism (same structure = same name)\n   - Alphabetical field ordering in names\n   - Union type names (Scala 3)\n\n5. **Selectable/Dynamic Implementation**\n   - Scala 3 Selectable field access\n   - Scala 2 Dynamic field access\n   - Field access correctness\n   - Missing field behavior\n   - Extra field behavior\n\n6. **Integration with Into/As**\n   - Nominal → Structural via Into\n   - Structural → Nominal via Into\n   - Round-trip via As\n   - Composed conversions with structural intermediary\n\n7. **Error Cases (Compile-Time)**\n   - Recursive types produce error\n   - Mutually recursive types produce error\n   - Sum types in Scala 2 produce error\n   - Unsupported types produce helpful errors\n\n8. **Generic Types** (if supported by existing Schema derivation)\n   - Fully applied generic → structural\n   - Generic with nested structural fields\n\n### Scala 2 vs Scala 3 Test Separation\n\n```\nsrc/test/scala/\n  structural/\n    common/\n      SimpleProductSpec.scala\n      NestedProductSpec.scala\n      CollectionsSpec.scala\n      TuplesSpec.scala\n      EmptyProductSpec.scala\n      SingleFieldSpec.scala\n      LargeProductSpec.scala\n      TypeNameNormalizationSpec.scala\n      IntoIntegrationSpec.scala\n      AsIntegrationSpec.scala\n      \n    scala3/\n      UnionTypesSpec.scala\n      SealedTraitToUnionSpec.scala\n      EnumToUnionSpec.scala\n      SelectableImplementationSpec.scala\n      \n    scala2/\n      DynamicImplementationSpec.scala\n      SumTypeErrorSpec.scala (verifies compile error)\n      \n    errors/\n      RecursiveTypeErrorSpec.scala\n      MutualRecursionErrorSpec.scala\n      UnsupportedTypeErrorSpec.scala\n```\n\n### Test Examples\n\n```scala\n// Test: Simple product to structural\ntest(\"case class converts to structural schema\") {\n  case class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n  \n  val structural = Schema.derived[Person].structural\n  \n  // Type check (this is a compile-time test)\n  val _: Schema[{ def name: String;

The system provides a typed API (`Patch[A]`) built on an untyped core (`DynamicPatch`) that operates on `DynamicValue`.\n\nBelow is a rough outline or sketch of the design of patching & diffing, subject to revision by the implementor based on technical feasibility considerations.\n\n## Core Architecture\n\n### Type Hierarchy\n\n```scala\n// Typed patch (user-facing API)\ncase class

PatchMode.Strict)\n}\n```\n\n## Diffing Strategy\n\nThe `Schema#diff` implementation uses smart heuristics:\n\n1. **New elements/keys**: Use `Operation.Set` \n   - Sequence insertions at new indices\n   - Map additions for new keys\n   - Sum type switches to different cases\n\n2. **String modifications**: Use `StringEdit` if edit sequence is shorter than new string, otherwise use `Set`\n\n3. **Numeric modifications**: Use delta operations (`IntDelta`, etc.)\n\n4. **Structural modifications**: Recursively diff nested structures, using field-level patches for records\n\n5. **Temporal modifications**: Use temporal delta operations for date/time types\n\n## Laws\n\n### Roundtrip Law\nFor all values, the following must hold:\n```scala\n∀ (schema: Schema[A], old: A, new: A).\n  schema.diff(old, new).apply(old) == Right(new)\n```\n\n### Monoid Laws\n```scala\n// Identity (empty patch)\n∀ (p: Patch[A]). \n  p ++ Patch.empty == p\n  Patch.empty ++ p == p\n\n// Associativity\n∀ (p1: Patch[A], p2: Patch[A], p3: Patch[A]).\n  (p1 ++ p2) ++ p3 == p1 ++ (p2 ++ p3)\n```\n\n### Serializability\nAll patch types are pure data (DynamicValue, DynamicOptic, primitives) and must be serializable:\n```scala\n∀ (p: Patch[A]). \n  jsonCodec.decode(jsonCodec.encode(p)) == Right(p)\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- `Operation.Set` uses `DynamicValue` to represent whole values for materialization cases\n- `Patch[A]` converts typed values to `DynamicValue` via `Schema[A]` before applying `DynamicPatch` constructor\n- String edits use LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) algorithm\n- Sequence edits also use LCS for computing minimal insert/delete sequences\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] `DynamicPatch` defined with all operation types, capable of transforming one DynamicValue to another in the most minimal possible way\n- [ ] `Patch[A]` wraps `DynamicPatch` with an additional `Schema[A]`\n- [ ] Typed API in `Patch` companion object for all common operations\n- [ ] `Schema#diff` implements smart diffing strategy\n- [ ] `PatchMode` controls patch application behavior\n- [ ] All fallible operations return `Either[SchemaError, A]` so error information is preserved\n- [ ] Roundtrip law holds for all schema types\n- [ ] Monoid laws hold for patch composition\n- [ ] All patch types serialize/deserialize correctly (except `Patch` itself, which cannot be serialized unless `Schema` is serialized, which in the general case requires a `TypeRegistry`)\n- [ ] String diffs use LCS algorithm\n- [ ] Sequence diffs use LCS algorithm\n- [ ] Comprehensive tests for all operation types, and for serialization of non-`Patch` types such as DynamicPatch and everything it contains\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```scala\n@schema \n@optics\ncase class Person(name: String,

The system provides a typed API (`Patch[A]`) built on an untyped core (`DynamicPatch`) that operates on `DynamicValue`.\n\nBelow is a rough outline or sketch of the design of patching & diffing, subject to revision by the implementor based on technical feasibility considerations.\n\n## Core Architecture\n\n### Type Hierarchy\n\n```scala\n// Typed patch (user-facing API)\ncase class

This is making it so I can't use the integration.\r\n\r\nWe also use Fastmail and have been seeing some oddities with the [cal.com](http://cal.com/) integration. Namely, that participants are receiving multiple calendar invites, which on it's own isn't that big of a deal. However, the Fastmail invites are always in UTC, not in the local time of the cal.com invite.\r\n\r\nThis is creating a lot of confusion with participants, they keep missing our meetings, not realizing one invite is UTC and one in local time. I spoke with the Fastmail team and they relayed the following notes about cal's specific integration.\r\n\r\n1. There is a property (SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT) a CalDAV client can add to the event that would prevent CalDAV servers from sending invitations. It appears cal.com is not setting this property even though they are sending an invitation.\r\n2. The invitation being sent by [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is using a different UID. Basically every event has a UID that uniquely identifies the event. Since [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is sending the invitation of the event with a different UID, if you end up adding this event to your calendar [cal.com](http://cal.com/), it will create a duplicate event in your calendar as well. They need to fix it so that all emails associated with a single event use the same original UID.\r\n3. The event added from [cal.com](http://cal.com/) doesn't have a timezone associated with it. Though it mentions the invitees timezone as \"America/Chicago\" in the notes, the event itself doesn't include a timezone and only specifies the time in UTC. Since the event time is specified in UTC, Fastmail's invitation email will also be sent in UTC.\r\n4. There seems to be no way to stop Cal.com from creating the calendar events at all, and thus no real workaround.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Connect to Fastmail using CalDav integration\r\n2. Create a test booking\r\n3. See issues above.\r\n\r\nAny other relevant information. For example, why do you consider this a bug and what did you expect to happen instead?\r\n1. SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT should be set, so Fastmail knows not to send an invitation. **This is the main one.**\r\n2. UID should be unique per event.\r\n3. Event time should have a timezone associated with it.\r\n4. An option could be added to make calendar event creation optional (nice-to-have, not essential).\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\n\r\nNone other than Fastmail/CalDAV.",

This functionality should enable users to select preferred notification times (e.g., 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour before the event) that automatically apply to all events created via Cal.com bookings. Currently, the absence of such a feature leads to missed appointments since default notifications set in Google Calendar do not apply to these events.
