Instead, I want to invite them to a specific project on Coolify and for them to only have access to that project.\n\nAdditionally, I want to optionally allow the project-specific member to deploy their own apps on the servers on the account. This will just create a new project in the Team with them as a project-specific member.\n\nI should be able to manage all project-specific members from the main team page in addition to on each project’s page.\n\nAny APIs that exist for managing team members should also work for project-specific members.\n\nThe purpose of this bounty is to create a secure way to give people limited access to projects on Coolify. They must not be able to break out of their permissions. For example, if I can SSH into a server as a project member using one of the keys - that would allow me to break out of my permissions.\n\nAcceptance criteria: Once your PR is merged and deployed on Coolify Cloud, I will test the features and award the bounty. Thanks!\n\n[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) previously awarded bounties to implement database SSL and APIs to manage backups. We’re a nonprofit for teenage coders!",

              "body": "### Request Type\n\nNew Feature\n\n### Description\n\n$1,000 USD bounty.\n\nAdd support for project-specific team members.\n\nProblem: I have team members I want to add to a project on Coolify, but I don’t want to give them access to the full account and to all projects on the server. Instead, I want to invite them to a specific project on Coolify and for them to only have access to that project.\n\nAdditionally, I want to optionally allow the project-specific member to deploy their own apps on the servers on the account. This will just create a new project in the Team with them as a project-specific member.\n\nI should be able to manage all project-specific members from the main team page in addition to on each project’s page.\n\nAny APIs that exist for managing team members should also work for project-specific members.\n\nThe purpose of this bounty is to create a secure way to give people limited access to projects on Coolify. They must not be able to break out of their permissions. For example, if I can SSH into a server as a project member using one of the keys - that would allow me to break out of my permissions.\n\nAcceptance criteria: Once your PR is merged and deployed on Coolify Cloud, I will test the features and award the bounty. Thanks!\n\n[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) previously awarded bounties to implement database SSL and APIs to manage backups. We’re a nonprofit for teenage coders!",

              "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nWe recently merged <https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/pull/3395> which adds a datetime payload index.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the datetime parser is very strict, only allowing [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) formats in our REST API. A common format such as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` is currently not accepted.\r\n\r\nIf you'd send the following request:\r\n\r\n```json\r\nPOST collections/test_collection/points/scroll\r\n{\r\n  \"limit\": 10,\r\n  \"filter\": {\r\n    \"must\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"updated\",\r\n        \"datetime_range\": {\r\n          \"gt\": \"2014-01-01T00:00:00\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'd receive the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFormat error in JSON body: data did not match any variant of untagged enum Condition at line 1 column 96\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error is very confusing.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe'd strongly prefer a more descriptive error message instead.\r\n\r\nSomething like this would be a lot better:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFormat error in JSON body: '2014-01-01T00:00:00' does not match any accepted datetime format\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n_None_\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nRelated issue: <https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/issues/3529>",
