To support any size database we should investigate enhancements to allow any sized database to be exported. Currently the size limitations are 1GB for Durable Objects with 10GB in the future. Operate under the assumption that we might be attempting to dump a 10GB database into a `.sql` file.\n\nAnother consideration to make is because Durable Objects execute synchronous operations we may need to allow for \"breathing intervals\". An example might be we allow our export operation to run for 5 seconds, and take 5 seconds off if other requests are in a queue, then it can pick up again. The goal here would be to prevent locking the database for long periods of time.\n\nBut then poses the questions: \n1. How do we continue operations that need more than 30 seconds to work?\n2. Where is the data stored as it's being created? (R2, S3, something else)?\n3. How do we deliver that dump information to the user after its completed?\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Hit the `/export/dump` endpoint on a large database\n2. Will eventually fail when the 30 second request response time window closes\n\nRun the following command in Terminal (replace the URL with yours) and if your operation exceeds 30 seconds you should see a failed network response instead of a dump file.\n```\ncurl --location 'https://starbasedb.YOUR-ID-HERE.workers.dev/export/dump' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' \\\n--output database_dump.sql\n```\n\nIf you can't create a large enough test database feel free to add code in to `sleep` for 29 seconds before proceeding with the `/export/dump` functional code and should also see the failure.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nAs a user I would expect any and all of the specified data to be dumped out without an error and without partial results. Where it ends up for the user to access if the operation takes more than 30 seconds is up for discussion. Ideally if shorter than 30 seconds it could be returned as our cURL above works today (downloads the file from the response of the origin request), but perhaps after the timeout it continues on uploads it to a destination source to access afterwards?\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n1. For backups require an R2 binding\n2. Have a `.sql` file that gets created in R2 with the filename like `dump_20240101-170000.sql` where it represents `2024-01-01 17:00:00`\n3. Create the file and continuously append new chunks to it until reaching the end\n4. May need to utilize a DO alarm to continue the work after X time if a timeout occurs & mark where it currently is in the process in internal memory so it can pick up and continue.\n5. Provide a callback URL when the operation is finally completed so users can create custom logic to notify them (e.g. Email, Slack, etc)",

              "body": "I am using zio 2.1.17. When I run the following code:\n\n```scala\ndef fakeNetworkCall(n: Int): ZIO[Any, Throwable, String] = {\n  for {\n    _ <- Console.printLine(s\"Starting request $n\")\n    _ <- ZIO.sleep(1.second)\n    _ <- Console.printLine(s\"Completed request $n\")\n  } yield s\"Response for $n\"\n}\n\nval program: ZIO[Any, Throwable, Unit] =\n  ZStream\n    .fromIterator(Iterator.from(1))\n    .mapZIO(fakeNetworkCall)\n    .buffer(1)\n    .runForeach { response =>\n      for {\n        _ <- Console.printLine(s\"Press Enter to process $response...\")\n        _ <- ZIO.sleep(100.minutes)\n        _ <- Console.printLine(s\"Processing response $response\")\n        _ <- ZIO.sleep(1.second)\n        _ <- Console.printLine(s\"Done processing $response\")\n      } yield ()\n    }\n```\nThe full code is [here](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/douglasthomsen/kvRuhoAGRjarj9djF53N0g/10).\n\nWhen i get to the `_ <- ZIO.sleep(100.minutes)` line I would expect the output to be like this:\n```\nStarting request 1\nCompleted request 1\nStarting request 2\nPress Enter to process Response for 1...\nCompleted request 2\n```\n\nbut I am getting the following:\n```\nStarting request 1\nCompleted request 1\nStarting request 2\nPress Enter to process Response for 1...\nCompleted request 2\nStarting request 3\nCompleted request 3\n```\n\nMy goal is to only buffer one call to `fakeNetworkCall` at time. Right now it looks like it is buffering two. I am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?",

Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",
