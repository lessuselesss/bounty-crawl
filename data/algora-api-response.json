Review the current implementation before making changes, and ensure that all new features follow existing coding patterns and standards.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 Triggers  \n\n| **Trigger** | **Use Case** |\n|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------|\n| **New Starred Email** | Fires when an email is starred (within 2 days).|\n| **New Conversation** | Fires when a new conversation (thread) begins.|\n|**New Attachment**|Fires when an email with an attachment arrives (with optional filters).|\n|**New Label**|Triggers when a new label is created.|\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Write Actions  \n\n| **Action Item**               | **Use Case** |\n|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------|\n| **Reply to Email** | Reply within an existing thread, maintaining context. |\n| **Create Draft Reply** | Generate a reply draft within an existing thread.|\n| **Add Label to Email** | Attach a label to an individual email.|\n|**Remove Label from Email**|Remove a specific label from an email.Remove a specific label from an email.|\n|**Create Label**|Create a new user label in Gmail.|\n|**Archive Email**|Archive (move to “All Mail”) rather than deleting.|\n|**Delete Email**|Permanently move an email to Trash.|\n|**Remove Label from Thread**|Strip a label from all emails in a thread.|\n---\n\n## 🔍 Search Actions  \n\n| **Action Item**               | **Use Case**                                                                                                                                     |\n|:------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Find Email** | Locate a specific email using search keywords like subject, sender, or content.|\n\n---\n\n\n## 📚 API Reference  \n- [Official Gmail API Documentation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/guides)\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Test Account Access  \nYou can test Gmail APIs using a Google account with enabled Gmail API in a [Google Cloud Project Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n\n---\n\n## 🧑‍💻 New to Activepieces?\n\nActivepieces is the leading open source AI automation platform. We have many apps (we call them Pieces), that are available within the builder and as MCPs. These apps are built with our TypeScript framework and are easy to develop. Once merged into our repository, they become available as pieces in our automation builder and as MCPs usable by AI agents and MCP clients.\n\nStart building here: [Piece Development Docs](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/developers/building-pieces/overview)\n",

Is `go-tree-sitter` strictly required for Katana, or only for certain features?  \n2. Are there any alternative pure-Go libraries we could use instead of `go-tree-sitter` to simplify cross-platform builds?  \n\nThis would help in making snapshot builds and CI/CD pipelines simpler, without needing to configure CGO or cross-compilers.  \n\nThanks!\n\n---\n\n### Use Case\n\n- Simplifying cross-platform builds (Windows → macOS/ARM)  \n- Avoiding CGO-related compilation issues  \n- Maintaining full functionality while reducing dependency complexity",

Since `go-tree-sitter` relies on CGO, cross-platform compilation (especially for darwin/arm64) becomes complicated.  \n\nI have a few questions:  \n1. Is `go-tree-sitter` strictly required for Katana, or only for certain features?  \n2. Are there any alternative pure-Go libraries we could use instead of `go-tree-sitter` to simplify cross-platform builds?  \n\nThis would help in making snapshot builds and CI/CD pipelines simpler, without needing to configure CGO or cross-compilers.  \n\nThanks!\n\n---\n\n### Use Case\n\n- Simplifying cross-platform builds (Windows → macOS/ARM)  \n- Avoiding CGO-related compilation issues  \n- Maintaining full functionality while reducing dependency complexity",

The aforementioned line is line 25737 of the output file, so more than 25k targets have been scanned before.\n\n### Anything else:\nThe issue always appears after a long time of execution. Execution of tlsx for the aforementioned approx. 30k targets (aborted/hanging after about 25k targets) started at `2025-04-24T16:50:47+00:00` and the process started hanging at `2025-04-25T10:47:39+0000`, so about 18 hours later.\n\nThe issue does not seem to depend on the specific target host, as tlsx correctly terminates when only scanning the target host. Also, it always starts hanging indefinitely for a different target, but always after having run for hours and after having already scanned several thousand targets,",

              "body": "### tlsx version:\nv1.1.9\n\n### Current Behavior:\nFor long target lists (in our case: Around 30k host/port combinations), tlsx reliably hangs indefinitely after several hours of execution, usually after around 25k targets have finished. Hanging happens even while writing JSONL output lines, cutting off a JSONL line somewhere in the middle.\n\n### Expected Behavior:\ntlsx should not hang indefinitely.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce:\ntlsx was started as follows:\n\n```\n~/go/bin/tlsx \\\n\t-list /tmp/host_port_combos.txt \\\n\t-scan-mode 'auto' \\\n\t-ip-version '4' \\\n\t-so \\\n\t-tls-version \\\n\t-cipher \\\n\t-hash 'sha256' \\\n\t-wildcard-cert \\\n\t-probe-status \\\n\t-version-enum \\\n\t-cipher-enum \\\n\t-cipher-type 'all' \\\n\t-serial \\\n\t-expired \\\n\t-self-signed \\\n\t-mismatched \\\n\t-revoked \\\n\t-untrusted \\\n\t-resolvers 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4,1.1.1.1 \\\n\t-certificate \\\n\t-tls-chain \\\n\t-concurrency '300' \\\n\t-cipher-concurrency '10' \\\n\t-timeout '5' \\\n\t-retry '3' \\\n\t-disable-update-check \\\n\t-output /tmp/tlsx_output.jsonl \\\n\t-json \\\n\t-no-color\n```\n\nAt one point, there is no more progress and even output is no longer written. This is the last line of the output file (`/tmp/tlsx_output.jsonl`):\n\n```\n{\"timestamp\":\"2025-04-25T09:59:31.489674682Z\",\"host\":\"xn--<censored>-t6b.<censored>\",\"ip\":\"<censored>\",\"port\":\"443\",\"probe_status\":true,\"tls_version\":\"tls13\",\"cipher\":\"TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\",\"self_signed\":true,\"mismatched\":true,\"not_before\":\"2017-01-16T16:04:01Z\",\"not_after\":\"2027-01-14T16:04:01Z\",\"subject_dn\":\"emailAddress=root@localhost.localdomain, CN=localhost.localdomain, OU=IT, O=MyCompany, L=Seattle, ST=WA, C=US, emailAddress=root@localhost.localdomain\",\"subject_cn\":\n```\nPlease note that the line ends with an open \"subject_cn\" key and the JSON object on that line is never closed. The aforementioned line is line 25737 of the output file, so more than 25k targets have been scanned before.\n\n### Anything else:\nThe issue always appears after a long time of execution. Execution of tlsx for the aforementioned approx. 30k targets (aborted/hanging after about 25k targets) started at `2025-04-24T16:50:47+00:00` and the process started hanging at `2025-04-25T10:47:39+0000`, so about 18 hours later.\n\nThe issue does not seem to depend on the specific target host, as tlsx correctly terminates when only scanning the target host. Also, it always starts hanging indefinitely for a different target, but always after having run for hours and after having already scanned several thousand targets,",
