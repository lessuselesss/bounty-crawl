Instead, I want to invite them to a specific project on Coolify and for them to only have access to that project.\n\nAdditionally, I want to optionally allow the project-specific member to deploy their own apps on the servers on the account.

They must not be able to break out of their permissions. For example, if I can SSH into a server as a project member using one of the keys - that would allow me to break out of my permissions.\n\nAcceptance criteria: Once your PR is merged and deployed on Coolify Cloud, I will test the features and award the bounty.

I’d like to propose adding the SparkFun MicroMod STM32 Processor to the funboards catalog.\n\n- Board: SparkFun MicroMod STM32 Processor (STM32F405RGT6)\n- Product page: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/21326\n- Hardware repo: https://github.com/sparkfun/MicroMod_STM32_Processor\n- Hookup guide: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/micromod-stm32-processor-hookup-guide\n- Schematic (PDF): https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/8/a/a/7/3/MicroMod_STM32_Processor.pdf\n\nWhy this board\n- Expands MicroMod coverage (M.2 “E-class” 22mm edge) and brings STM32F4 (Cortex-M4) into the catalog.\n- Reusable mapping: once the MicroMod edge connector + STM32F405 pins are modeled, other MicroMod processors benefit.\n- Complexity: moderate/advanced (MCU, HSE/LSE clocks, boot/reset gating, SPI flash, SDIO, USB, SWD). Seems like a mid-tier bounty candidate.\n\nDuplication check\n- I checked the public boards list in `tscircuit/sparkfun-boards/boards/` and did not find this board at time of filing.\n- Also glanced at the org project board (https://github.com/orgs/tscircuit/projects/6) and didn’t see it in progress. Please correct me if I missed it.\n\nPlanned implementation (TSX; no XY tooling)\n- Schematic (TSX):\n  - `STM32F405RG` (LQFP-64) with VDDx/VDDA/VSSA, `VCAP1/2` decoupling, `PH0/PH1` 12MHz HSE, `PC14/PC15` 32.768kHz LSE.\n  - SPI flash W25Qxx (WSON-8 6x5) on SPI1 (PA5/PA6/PA7) + `PC4` CS#; HOLD#/WP# as per schematic.\n  - MicroMod edge symbol with named pins: 3.3V, GNDs, `USB_D±`, `USB_VIN`, `RTC_3V`, `3.3V_EN`, `!RESET!`, `!BOOT!`, SWDIO/SWCLK, SDIO, SPI, I2C, UART, BUS/GPIO.\n  - Boot/reset: `BOOT0` gating via P‑MOSFET (DMG2305UX‑7), RC on `NRST`, `PB2` (BOOT1) strapped.\n- PCB (TSX):\n  - 22mm MicroMod card outline with chamfer; custom edge pad footprint (pads 1–75) per MicroMod spec.\n  - Place LQFP‑64, crystals (3225/3215), WSON‑8 flash, decoupling; indicative routing for visuals.\n- Artifacts: snapshots/renders via `tsci snapshot`.\n\nAcceptance/questions\n- Can you confirm it’s green to proceed and eligible for a bounty? If so, please attach a bounty and assign.\n- Any preference for edge connector footprint naming or a canonical MicroMod footprint I should reuse?\n- Any constraints (e.g., minimum visual fidelity for the edge connector, keepout notches, silk expectations)?\n- Any components/modules to avoid for funboards? (I’ve avoided relying on XY import.)\n\nEstimated effort\n- 1–2 days for faithful schematic + functional PCB visualization (including custom edge footprint) and snapshots.\n\nThanks! Happy to adapt to preferred structure or scope.\n",

              "body": "I am using zio 2.1.17. When I run the following code:\n\n```scala\ndef fakeNetworkCall(n: Int): ZIO[Any, Throwable, String] = {\n  for {\n    _ <- Console.printLine(s\"Starting request $n\")\n    _ <- ZIO.sleep(1.second)\n    _ <- Console.printLine(s\"Completed request $n\")\n  } yield s\"Response for $n\"\n}\n\nval program: ZIO[Any, Throwable, Unit] =\n  ZStream\n    .fromIterator(Iterator.from(1))\n    .mapZIO(fakeNetworkCall)\n    .buffer(1)\n    .runForeach { response =>\n      for {\n        _ <- Console.printLine(s\"Press Enter to process $response...\")\n        _ <- ZIO.sleep(100.minutes)\n        _ <- Console.printLine(s\"Processing response $response\")\n        _ <- ZIO.sleep(1.second)\n        _ <- Console.printLine(s\"Done processing $response\")\n      } yield ()\n    }\n```\nThe full code is [here](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/douglasthomsen/kvRuhoAGRjarj9djF53N0g/10).\n\nWhen i get to the `_ <- ZIO.sleep(100.minutes)` line I would expect the output to be like this:\n```\nStarting request 1\nCompleted request 1\nStarting request 2\nPress Enter to process Response for 1...\nCompleted request 2\n```\n\nbut I am getting the following:\n```\nStarting request 1\nCompleted request 1\nStarting request 2\nPress Enter to process Response for 1...\nCompleted request 2\nStarting request 3\nCompleted request 3\n```\n\nMy goal is to only buffer one call to `fakeNetworkCall` at time. Right now it looks like it is buffering two. I am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?",

This is making it so I can't use the integration.\r\n\r\nWe also use Fastmail and have been seeing some oddities with the [cal.com](http://cal.com/) integration. Namely, that participants are receiving multiple calendar invites, which on it's own isn't that big of a deal. However, the Fastmail invites are always in UTC, not in the local time of the cal.com invite.\r\n\r\nThis is creating a lot of confusion with participants, they keep missing our meetings, not realizing one invite is UTC and one in local time. I spoke with the Fastmail team and they relayed the following notes about cal's specific integration.\r\n\r\n1. There is a property (SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT) a CalDAV client can add to the event that would prevent CalDAV servers from sending invitations. It appears cal.com is not setting this property even though they are sending an invitation.\r\n2. The invitation being sent by [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is using a different UID. Basically every event has a UID that uniquely identifies the event. Since [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is sending the invitation of the event with a different UID, if you end up adding this event to your calendar [cal.com](http://cal.com/), it will create a duplicate event in your calendar as well. They need to fix it so that all emails associated with a single event use the same original UID.\r\n3. The event added from [cal.com](http://cal.com/) doesn't have a timezone associated with it. Though it mentions the invitees timezone as \"America/Chicago\" in the notes, the event itself doesn't include a timezone and only specifies the time in UTC. Since the event time is specified in UTC, Fastmail's invitation email will also be sent in UTC.\r\n4. There seems to be no way to stop Cal.com from creating the calendar events at all, and thus no real workaround.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Connect to Fastmail using CalDav integration\r\n2. Create a test booking\r\n3. See issues above.\r\n\r\nAny other relevant information. For example, why do you consider this a bug and what did you expect to happen instead?\r\n1. SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT should be set, so Fastmail knows not to send an invitation. **This is the main one.**\r\n2. UID should be unique per event.\r\n3. Event time should have a timezone associated with it.\r\n4. An option could be added to make calendar event creation optional (nice-to-have, not essential).\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\n\r\nNone other than Fastmail/CalDAV.",

It appears cal.com is not setting this property even though they are sending an invitation.\r\n2. The invitation being sent by [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is using a different UID. Basically every event has a UID that uniquely identifies the event. Since [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is sending the invitation of the event with a different UID, if you end up adding this event to your calendar [cal.com](http://cal.com/), it will create a duplicate event in your calendar as well. They need to fix it so that all emails associated with a single event use the same original UID.\r\n3. The event added from [cal.com](http://cal.com/) doesn't have a timezone associated with it. Though it mentions the invitees timezone as \"America/Chicago\" in the notes, the event itself doesn't include a timezone and only specifies the time in UTC. Since the event time is specified in UTC, Fastmail's invitation email will also be sent in UTC.\r\n4. There seems to be no way to stop Cal.com from creating the calendar events at all, and thus no real workaround.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Connect to Fastmail using CalDav integration\r\n2. Create a test booking\r\n3. See issues above.\r\n\r\nAny other relevant information. For example, why do you consider this a bug and what did you expect to happen instead?\r\n1. SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT should be set, so Fastmail knows not to send an invitation. **This is the main one.**\r\n2. UID should be unique per event.\r\n3. Event time should have a timezone associated with it.\r\n4. An option could be added to make calendar event creation optional (nice-to-have, not essential).\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\n\r\nNone other than Fastmail/CalDAV.",
