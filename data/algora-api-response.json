Stripe doesn't have that capability. I'd like to see Lawpay (Affinipay) offered as a gateway option since they have an open API and integrate easily with other scheduling programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThe ability to connect Cal.com to Lawpay as a payment processor for appointment bookings\r\n\r\n### Requirement/Document\r\n\r\n[Lawpay Integration Partners](https://www.lawpay.com/partners/integrated-partners/)\r\n[API Reference Documents](https://developers.affinipay.com/reference/api.html)\r\n\r\n",
