For example during my [boat project](https://discuss.px4.io/t/rc-speed-boat-with-px4-episode-1-using-px4-to-control-the-boat/28429#things-that-are-still-ambiguous-to-me-22) build, I wasn't sure if I needed to set the priority of magnetometer manually or not.\r\n\r\nThis is also quite related to the calibration pain addressed in the issue #19459. What can we do to improve user experience for setting up the sensors? If so, which part should be addressed and how?\r\n\r\nWhat could be great (in my opinion) could be something like this in QGC (it won't be a literal text output like this, but just for giving some idea):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # First mag sensor\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # One for the second mag\r\n<baro-type> |              | <baro-priority> | <baro-protocol>\r\n<gyro-type> | <gyro-orientation> | <gyro-priority> | <gyro-protocol>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I am also not sure what others expectation / needs are, so any feedback would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n## Describe your preferred solution\r\n* @davids5 pointed out that transferring device tree information over to QGC could be a solution. Could you elaborate on that?\r\n* @dagar pointed out that having a unified view in general would be good. Could you let me know if a view I suggested above is similar to what you have imagined?\r\n",

              "body": "## Describe problem solved by the proposed feature\r\nCurrently it is hard to figure out which sensors are connected where, with which configuration and which priority (e.g. `CAL_MAG0_PRIO`) in a single view. For example during my [boat project](https://discuss.px4.io/t/rc-speed-boat-with-px4-episode-1-using-px4-to-control-the-boat/28429#things-that-are-still-ambiguous-to-me-22) build, I wasn't sure if I needed to set the priority of magnetometer manually or not.\r\n\r\nThis is also quite related to the calibration pain addressed in the issue #19459. What can we do to improve user experience for setting up the sensors? If so, which part should be addressed and how?\r\n\r\nWhat could be great (in my opinion) could be something like this in QGC (it won't be a literal text output like this, but just for giving some idea):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # First mag sensor\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # One for the second mag\r\n<baro-type> |              | <baro-priority> | <baro-protocol>\r\n<gyro-type> | <gyro-orientation> | <gyro-priority> | <gyro-protocol>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I am also not sure what others expectation / needs are, so any feedback would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n## Describe your preferred solution\r\n* @davids5 pointed out that transferring device tree information over to QGC could be a solution. Could you elaborate on that?\r\n* @dagar pointed out that having a unified view in general would be good. Could you let me know if a view I suggested above is similar to what you have imagined?\r\n",

Along with the request, I send a `Promise` to have that fiber communicate the outcome of that action to me. By and large this works fine. The issue arises when the fiber that I'm sending requests to fails. In that case, I would like it to communicate the cause of the failure back to the other fibers. This is easy enough for the requests that I've already pulled out of the queue: I simply fail those promises.\nBut I also need to deal with other cases: fibers currently blocked in an `offer` call, future attempts to `offer` to the queue, and I also need to deal with requests that have been submitted to the queue but not yet retrieved.\n\nSo my idea is as follows:\n - add an `E` type parameter to `Queue`\n - add a `shutdownCause` method that takes a type parameter of type `Cause[E]`\n - `shutdownCause` would also return the items currently buffered in the queue in order to dispose of them\n - after `shutdownCause` has been called, any attempt to interact with the queue will fail with the cause\n - methods like `take, offer` etc. should indicate errors of type `E`\n - streams created with `ZStream.fromQueue` would also fail with this cause\n - `shutdownCause` should be atomic: when multiple fibers call it at the same time, one of them wins and the others fail with the cause supplied by the winner\n\nAfaik, adding a new method is a binary compatible change, as is adding a new type parameter. Hence I think this is a source incompatible but binary compatible change. @ghostdogpr therefore suggested it could be added in a ZIO 2.2 release.\n",

In `parseDockerComposeFile()` for the Application model (around line 2066), add:\n   ```php\n   $isDatabase = isDatabaseImage($image, $service);\n   data_set($service, 'is_database', $isDatabase);\n   ```\n\n2.

There is no configuration to turn this on or off with ease, or even commented out docker-compose, nor any notes.\n2. With how we expose Kong via URL by default, the approach in the document could be messy or unsafe\n3. It looks like additional configuration may be required if there are multiple Supabase instances on the same server with individual /mcp exposures as Traefik is handling the routing and everything is using the same ports, etc...\n\n**I am looking for a \"work around\" as the resolution for this bounty.** That is acceptable, but I will require **at minimum a tutorial below** that figures out how to get around this bug/issue and properly documents the following:\n\n- How to configure the MCP and use it on local network\n- How to setup Wireguard to properly allow for usage of this MCP\n- How to configure Cursor/Claude Code/Windsurf to use this MCP\n- **MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOW TO CONNECT TO DIFFERENT SUPABASE INSTANCES ON THE SAME COOLIFY INSTANCE (assuming all of them are running the default Service template)**\n\nCreating a fix within the system we have to spin up and manage a Supabase instance may be difficult due to the template system's restraints, but if you want to work on that complaint of mine and **earn much more than $15**, you can see the bottom of this post. I list off the other bounties I will be offering and putting up cash for upon clearing some wires and hopefully seeing someone (or a few people) dedicate time to it.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Follow docs linked above\n2. Attempt to edit the docker and piece it all together as tutorial says\n3. ???\n\n\n\n### Example Repository URL\n\n_No response_\n\n### Coolify Version\n\nv4.0.0-beta.452\n\n### Are you using Coolify Cloud?\n\nNo (self-hosted)\n\n### Operating System and Version (self-hosted)\n\nUbuntu 24.04.03\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI am starting this bounty small as I have no clue how this system works and if I will be able to add crypto or not.

There is no configuration to turn this on or off with ease, or even commented out docker-compose, nor any notes.\n2. With how we expose Kong via URL by default, the approach in the document could be messy or unsafe\n3. It looks like additional configuration may be required if there are multiple Supabase instances on the same server with individual /mcp exposures as Traefik is handling the routing and everything is using the same ports, etc...\n\n**I am looking for a \"work around\" as the resolution for this bounty.** That is acceptable, but I will require **at minimum a tutorial below** that figures out how to get around this bug/issue and properly documents the following:\n\n- How to configure the MCP and use it on local network\n- How to setup Wireguard to properly allow for usage of this MCP\n- How to configure Cursor/Claude Code/Windsurf to use this MCP\n- **MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOW TO CONNECT TO DIFFERENT SUPABASE INSTANCES ON THE SAME COOLIFY INSTANCE (assuming all of them are running the default Service template)**\n\nCreating a fix within the system we have to spin up and manage a Supabase instance may be difficult due to the template system's restraints, but if you want to work on that complaint of mine and **earn much more than $15**, you can see the bottom of this post. I list off the other bounties I will be offering and putting up cash for upon clearing some wires and hopefully seeing someone (or a few people) dedicate time to it.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1.
