                  "body": "I have attached to this ticket a WIT file that describes a generic interface for text-to-speech operations. This interface can be implemented by various providers, either by emulating features not present in a given provider, utilizing the provider's native support for a feature, or indicating an error if a particular combination is not natively supported by a provider.\n\nThe intent of this WIT specification is to allow developers of WASM components (on wasmCloud, Spin, or Golem) to leverage text-to-speech capabilities to build voice-powered applications, accessibility services, and audio content generation systems in a portable and provider-agnostic fashion.\n\nThis ticket involves constructing implementations of this WIT interface for the following providers:\n\n- **ElevenLabs**: The leading AI voice synthesis platform with comprehensive voice cloning, real-time streaming, voice conversion, and sound effects generation capabilities.\n- **AWS Polly**: Amazon's enterprise text-to-speech service with extensive language support, custom lexicons, speech marks, and asynchronous synthesis for long-form content.\n- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech**: Google's neural voice synthesis service with WaveNet and Neural2 voices, device optimization profiles, and streaming synthesis capabilities.\n- **Deepgram Aura**: High-performance real-time TTS with session-based streaming, low-latency neural voices, and conversational AI optimization.\n\nThese implementations must be written in Rust and compilable to WASM Components (WASI 0.23 only, since Golem does not yet support WASI 0.3). The standard Rust toolchain for WASM component development can be employed (see cargo component and the Rust examples of components in this and other Golem repositories).\n\nAdditionally, these implementations should incorporate custom durability semantics using the Golem durability API and the Golem host API. This approach ensures that durability is managed at the level of individual TTS operations (voice synthesis, streaming session creation, voice cloning, batch processing), providing a higher-level and clearer operation log, which aids in debugging and monitoring. See golem:llm and golem:embed for more details and durable implementations in this same repository.\n\nThe final deliverables associated with this ticket are:\n\n- **ElevenLabs implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-elevenlabs.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **AWS Polly implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-polly.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Google Cloud TTS implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-google.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Deepgram Aura implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-deepgram.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n\n**Note**: If you have a strong recommendation to swap out one or two of these with other popular / common TTS providers (such as Azure Cognitive Services Speech, IBM Watson Text to Speech, or OpenAI TTS), then as long as you get permission beforehand, that's okay with me. However, we definitely need ElevenLabs and AWS Polly.\n\nThese components will require runtime configuration, notably API keys, endpoint URLs, authentication credentials, and provider-specific settings. For configuring this information, the components can use environment variables for now (in the future, they will use wasi-runtime-config, but Golem does not support this yet, whereas Golem has good support for environment variables).\n\nMoreover, the Rust components need to be tested within Golem to ensure compatibility with Golem 1.2.x.\n\nThis WIT has been designed by examining and comparing the APIs of ElevenLabs, AWS Polly, Google Cloud TTS, Azure Speech Services, OpenAI TTS, and Deepgram Aura. However, given there are no implementations, it is possible the provided WIT is not the optimal abstraction across all these providers. Therefore, deviations from the proposed design can be made. However, to be accepted, any deviation must be fully justified and deemed by Golem core contributors to be an improvement from the original specification.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\nEach provider implementation should handle the following key mapping considerations:\n\n- **Voice Management**: Map the unified voice resource to provider-specific voice identifiers, handle voice discovery and metadata appropriately for each provider's voice catalog structure\n- **Audio Format Conversion**: Implement native audio format support where available, or provide format conversion for unsupported output formats using audio processing libraries\n- **Streaming Implementation**: Utilize native streaming APIs where supported (ElevenLabs, Deepgram), or implement chunk-based synthesis for providers without native streaming support\n- **Authentication Handling**: Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, service accounts) per provider requirements\n- **Feature Availability**: Route advanced features (voice cloning, sound effects, speech marks) through provider-native APIs where supported, or return `unsupported-operation` errors for unavailable features\n- **Error Mapping**: Map provider-specific HTTP errors and API responses to the unified `tts-error` enumeration with appropriate context preservation\n- **Rate Limiting**: Handle provider-specific rate limits and quota management, implementing appropriate retry logic and error reporting\n- **Long-form Content**: Implement efficient handling of long-form synthesis using provider-native async operations (AWS Polly) or intelligent chunking strategies\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nEach implementation must include comprehensive test suites covering:\n- Basic synthesis operations (text-to-speech with various voices and configurations)\n- Voice discovery and metadata retrieval\n- Streaming synthesis lifecycle (session creation, chunk processing, cleanup)\n- Advanced feature testing (voice cloning, sound effects, custom pronunciations where supported)\n- Audio format validation and quality verification\n- Authentication and authorization scenarios\n- Error handling for unsupported operations and malformed inputs\n- Rate limiting and quota management behavior\n- Connection management and retry logic\n- Long-form content synthesis (>5000 characters)\n- Durability semantics verification across operation boundaries\n- Provider-specific feature utilization (lexicons for Polly, voice settings for ElevenLabs, etc.)\n\n## Configuration Requirements\n\nEach implementation should support the following environment variables:\n\n### Common Configuration\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT`: Custom endpoint URL (for enterprise/regional deployments)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)\n\n### Provider-Specific Configuration\n- **ElevenLabs**: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_MODEL_VERSION`\n- **AWS Polly**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`\n- **Google Cloud**: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`\n- **Deepgram**: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_VERSION`\n\n```wit\npackage

              "body": "I have attached to this ticket a WIT file that describes a generic interface for text-to-speech operations. This interface can be implemented by various providers, either by emulating features not present in a given provider, utilizing the provider's native support for a feature, or indicating an error if a particular combination is not natively supported by a provider.\n\nThe intent of this WIT specification is to allow developers of WASM components (on wasmCloud, Spin, or Golem) to leverage text-to-speech capabilities to build voice-powered applications, accessibility services, and audio content generation systems in a portable and provider-agnostic fashion.\n\nThis ticket involves constructing implementations of this WIT interface for the following providers:\n\n- **ElevenLabs**: The leading AI voice synthesis platform with comprehensive voice cloning, real-time streaming, voice conversion, and sound effects generation capabilities.\n- **AWS Polly**: Amazon's enterprise text-to-speech service with extensive language support, custom lexicons, speech marks, and asynchronous synthesis for long-form content.\n- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech**: Google's neural voice synthesis service with WaveNet and Neural2 voices, device optimization profiles, and streaming synthesis capabilities.\n- **Deepgram Aura**: High-performance real-time TTS with session-based streaming, low-latency neural voices, and conversational AI optimization.\n\nThese implementations must be written in Rust and compilable to WASM Components (WASI 0.23 only, since Golem does not yet support WASI 0.3). The standard Rust toolchain for WASM component development can be employed (see cargo component and the Rust examples of components in this and other Golem repositories).\n\nAdditionally, these implementations should incorporate custom durability semantics using the Golem durability API and the Golem host API. This approach ensures that durability is managed at the level of individual TTS operations (voice synthesis, streaming session creation, voice cloning, batch processing), providing a higher-level and clearer operation log, which aids in debugging and monitoring. See golem:llm and golem:embed for more details and durable implementations in this same repository.\n\nThe final deliverables associated with this ticket are:\n\n- **ElevenLabs implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-elevenlabs.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **AWS Polly implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-polly.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Google Cloud TTS implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-google.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n- **Deepgram Aura implementation**: A WASM Component (WASI 0.23), named `tts-deepgram.wasm`, with a full test suite and custom durability implementation at the level of TTS operations.\n\n**Note**: If you have a strong recommendation to swap out one or two of these with other popular / common TTS providers (such as Azure Cognitive Services Speech, IBM Watson Text to Speech, or OpenAI TTS), then as long as you get permission beforehand, that's okay with me. However, we definitely need ElevenLabs and AWS Polly.\n\nThese components will require runtime configuration, notably API keys, endpoint URLs, authentication credentials, and provider-specific settings. For configuring this information, the components can use environment variables for now (in the future, they will use wasi-runtime-config, but Golem does not support this yet, whereas Golem has good support for environment variables).\n\nMoreover, the Rust components need to be tested within Golem to ensure compatibility with Golem 1.2.x.\n\nThis WIT has been designed by examining and comparing the APIs of ElevenLabs, AWS Polly, Google Cloud TTS, Azure Speech Services, OpenAI TTS, and Deepgram Aura. However, given there are no implementations, it is possible the provided WIT is not the optimal abstraction across all these providers. Therefore, deviations from the proposed design can be made. However, to be accepted, any deviation must be fully justified and deemed by Golem core contributors to be an improvement from the original specification.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\nEach provider implementation should handle the following key mapping considerations:\n\n- **Voice Management**: Map the unified voice resource to provider-specific voice identifiers, handle voice discovery and metadata appropriately for each provider's voice catalog structure\n- **Audio Format Conversion**: Implement native audio format support where available, or provide format conversion for unsupported output formats using audio processing libraries\n- **Streaming Implementation**: Utilize native streaming APIs where supported (ElevenLabs, Deepgram), or implement chunk-based synthesis for providers without native streaming support\n- **Authentication Handling**: Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, service accounts) per provider requirements\n- **Feature Availability**: Route advanced features (voice cloning, sound effects, speech marks) through provider-native APIs where supported, or return `unsupported-operation` errors for unavailable features\n- **Error Mapping**: Map provider-specific HTTP errors and API responses to the unified `tts-error` enumeration with appropriate context preservation\n- **Rate Limiting**: Handle provider-specific rate limits and quota management, implementing appropriate retry logic and error reporting\n- **Long-form Content**: Implement efficient handling of long-form synthesis using provider-native async operations (AWS Polly) or intelligent chunking strategies\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nEach implementation must include comprehensive test suites covering:\n- Basic synthesis operations (text-to-speech with various voices and configurations)\n- Voice discovery and metadata retrieval\n- Streaming synthesis lifecycle (session creation, chunk processing, cleanup)\n- Advanced feature testing (voice cloning, sound effects, custom pronunciations where supported)\n- Audio format validation and quality verification\n- Authentication and authorization scenarios\n- Error handling for unsupported operations and malformed inputs\n- Rate limiting and quota management behavior\n- Connection management and retry logic\n- Long-form content synthesis (>5000 characters)\n- Durability semantics verification across operation boundaries\n- Provider-specific feature utilization (lexicons for Polly, voice settings for ElevenLabs, etc.)\n\n## Configuration Requirements\n\nEach implementation should support the following environment variables:\n\n### Common Configuration\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT`: Custom endpoint URL (for enterprise/regional deployments)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)\n- `TTS_PROVIDER_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)\n\n### Provider-Specific Configuration\n- **ElevenLabs**: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_MODEL_VERSION`\n- **AWS Polly**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`\n- **Google Cloud**: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`\n- **Deepgram**: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_VERSION`\n\n```wit\npackage

This limitation prevents us from properly segmenting user activity into coherent sessions.\n\n## 1. Current Workaround\ninternally I implementing a suboptimal solution that:\n1. Queries all OCR database entries chronologically\n2. Manually identifies session boundaries by analyzing timestamp sequences for each application\n3. Determines session end when detecting a different application in subsequent timestamps\n4.

Requirements\n\n1.  **Session Definition:** A \"session\" should be defined as a continuous period of user interaction with a specific application and window.  A break in activity (e.g., switching to a different application or window) should end the current session and potentially start a new one.  A configurable inactivity timeout (e.g., 5 minutes) should also end a session.\n\n2.  **Data Storage:** The database schema must be modified to store session start and end times, associated with specific applications and windows.  It must maintain links to the relevant OCR and audio data chunks.\n\n3.  **API Endpoint:**  A new or modified API endpoint (e.g., `/sessions`) is needed to query for session data.  This endpoint should support filtering by:\n    *   Date range (start and end timestamps).\n    *   Application name.\n    *   Window name.\n    *   Minimum and maximum session duration.\n    *   Associated tags.\n    *   Pagination (limit and offset).\n\n4.  **Real-time Capability:** The system should be able to detect session boundaries in near real-time as data is being ingested. This implies integration with the existing data capture and processing pipeline.\n\n5. **Configurability:** The inactivity timeout for ending a session should be configurable.\n\n## 3. Proposed Solution\n\n### 3.1. Database Schema Changes\n\nWe'll introduce a new table `sessions` and modify the existing tables.\n\n**New Table: `sessions`**\n\n| Column Name      | Data Type  | Constraints                                  | Description                                                                  |\n| :--------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `id`             | INTEGER    | PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT                    | Unique identifier for the session.                                       |\n| `app_name`       | TEXT       | NOT NULL                                     | Name of the application.                                                 |\n| `window_name`    | TEXT       |                                               | Title of the window.                                                     |\n| `start_time`     | DATETIME   | NOT NULL                                     | Timestamp of the session start.                                            |\n| `end_time`       | DATETIME   | NOT NULL                                     | Timestamp of the session end.                                              |\n| `duration_secs`  | REAL       | NOT NULL                                     | Duration of the session in seconds.                                        |\n\n**Modified Tables:**\n\n*   **`ocr_text`**: Add a `session_id` column (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY referencing `sessions.id`).\n*   **`audio_transcriptions`**: Add a `session_id` column (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY referencing `sessions.id`).\n*   **`ui_monitoring`**: Add a `session_id` column (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY referencing `sessions.id`).\n\n**Indexes:**\n\n*   Create indexes on `sessions` table columns (`app_name`, `window_name`, `start_time`, `end_time`) for efficient querying.\n*   Create indexes on the `session_id` columns in `ocr_text`, `audio_transcriptions`, and `ui_monitoring`.\n\n### 3.2. API Enhancements\n\nWe'll modify the existing `/search` endpoint to also support session queries.\n\n**Request:**\n\n```\nGET /search?content_type=session&app_name=Cursor&start_time=2024-11-27T00:00:00Z&end_time=2024-11-28T00:00:00Z&min_duration=60&limit=10&offset=0\n```\n\n*   `content_type=session`: Indicates a session-based search.\n*   `app_name`, `window_name`: Filter by application and window (optional).\n*   `start_time`, `end_time`: Date range for the session (optional, defaults to last 24 hours).\n*   `min_duration`, `max_duration`: Filter by session duration in seconds (optional).\n*   `limit`, `offset`: Pagination parameters.\n\n\nafter discussing with @louis030195 on discord he proposed something like this as the output\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"app_name\": \"Cursor\",\n      \"total_usage_time\": 3600,\n      \"windows\": [\n        {\n          \"window_name\": \"page.tsx\",\n          \"sessions\": [\n            {\n              \"start_time\": \"2024-07-16T12:00:00Z\",\n              \"end_time\": \"2024-07-16T12:30:00Z\",\n              \"duration\": 1800,\n              \"content_ids\": [123, 124, 125],\n              \"tags\": [\"coding\", \"frontend\"]\n            },\n            {\n              \"start_time\": \"2024-07-16T14:00:00Z\",\n              \"end_time\": \"2024-07-16T14:30:00Z\",\n              \"duration\": 1800,\n              \"content_ids\": [223, 224, 225],\n              \"tags\": [\"coding\", \"frontend\"]\n            }\n          ],\n          \"total_usage_time\": 3600\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"app_name\": \"Arc\",\n      \"total_usage_time\": 1200,\n      \"windows\": [\n        {\n          \"window_name\": \"x.com\",\n          \"sessions\": [\n            {\n              \"start_time\": \"2024-07-16T10:30:00Z\",\n              \"end_time\": \"2024-07-16T10:50:00Z\",\n              \"duration\": 1200,\n              \"content_ids\": [126, 127, 128],\n              \"tags\": [\"browsing\", \"social-media\"]\n            }\n          ],\n          \"total_usage_time\": 1200\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"pagination\": {\n    \"limit\": 50,\n    \"offset\": 0,\n    \"total\": 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3.3. Session Boundary Detection Logic\n\n1.  **Real-time Monitoring:**  The existing event listeners for OCR, audio, and UI events will be leveraged.\n\n2.  **Session Tracking:**  Maintain a data structure (likely in memory, possibly augmented with periodic database writes for persistence) to track active sessions.  This structure should map:\n    *   `(app_name, window_name)` -> `(session_id, last_activity_timestamp)`\n\n3.  **New Event Handling:**\n    *   When a new event (OCR, audio, UI) arrives:\n        *   Extract `app_name` and `window_name`.\n        *   Check if an active session exists for this (app, window) combination.\n        *   If a session exists:\n            *   Check if `now() - last_activity_timestamp` exceeds the inactivity timeout.\n            *   If timeout exceeded, end the existing session and create a new one.\n            *   If not timed out, update `last_activity_timestamp` to the event's timestamp.\n        *   If no session exists:\n            *   Create a new session with `start_time` and `end_time` set to the event's timestamp.\n            *   Generate a new `session_id`.\n            *   Insert a new row into the `sessions` table.\n        *   Insert the new data (OCR, audio, UI) into the relevant table, linking it to the active `session_id`.\n\n4.  **Inactivity Timeout:** A configurable timeout (e.g., 5 minutes) will be used to determine session end due to inactivity.\n\n5.  **Periodic Flushing:** To avoid excessive in-memory state, periodically flush closed sessions (those that have exceeded the inactivity timeout) to the database.\n\n6. **Data Migration:** A migration script will be needed to analyze existing data and create initial session records based on timestamp proximity and app/window changes.\n\n### 3.4. Implementation Details\n\n*   **Language/Framework:** Continue using Rust for core logic and database interaction.\n*   **Database:** Continue using SQLite.\n*   **Concurrency:** Use asynchronous operations with `tokio` for handling concurrent events and database interactions.  Leverage `Arc` and `Mutex` for shared state, and channels for communication between tasks.\n*   **Configuration:** Add a new setting for the inactivity timeout.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling with `anyhow` and propagate errors appropriately. Log errors using `tracing`.\n* **Testing:** Thoroughly test session boundary detection with various scenarios, including rapid switching, long inactivity periods, and concurrent events.\n\n## 4.

New API Endpoint (Modified /search)\n\nThe existing `/search` endpoint will be extended to support session-based queries.  No new endpoint is needed.\n\n## 5. Performance Implications\n\n*   **Database:**  The addition of the `sessions` table and foreign keys will add some overhead to write operations.  Proper indexing is crucial to mitigate this.  Read performance for session-based queries should be good with appropriate indexes.\n*   **Memory:**  The in-memory session tracking will require additional memory.  The size of this will depend on the number of concurrent users and the configured timeout.  This should be monitored and potentially optimized (e.g., using a more efficient data structure than a simple `HashMap`).\n*   **CPU:**  The session boundary detection logic will add some CPU overhead.  This should be minimized by efficient checks and the use of asynchronous operations.\n\n## 6. Migration Path\n\n1.  **Add new `sessions` table.**\n2.  **Add `session_id` columns** to `ocr_text`, `audio_transcriptions`, and `ui_monitoring` tables.\n3.  **Backfill `session_id`:**  A migration script will be needed to analyze existing data and create initial session records.  This script will need to:\n    *   Iterate through existing OCR, audio, and UI data in chronological order.\n    *   Apply the session boundary detection logic (described above) to group data into sessions.\n    *   Insert corresponding rows into the `sessions` table.\n    *   Update the `session_id` foreign key in the existing tables.\n\n\n## 7. Alternative Approaches\n\n1.  **Session Table per Content Type:** Instead of a single `sessions` table, we could have separate session tables for each content type (e.g., `ocr_sessions`, `audio_sessions`, `ui_sessions`).  This might simplify queries for a specific content type but could make cross-content type analysis more complex.\n2.  **No Session Table (Denormalized):** We could add `start_time` and `end_time` directly to the existing tables (`ocr_text`, `audio_transcriptions`, `ui_monitoring`). This would avoid the need for joins when querying for sessions, but could lead to data redundancy and potential inconsistencies.\n3.  any other suggestions ????\n",

API Enhancements\n\nWe'll modify the existing `/search` endpoint to also support session queries.\n\n**Request:**\n\n```\nGET /search?content_type=session&app_name=Cursor&start_time=2024-11-27T00:00:00Z&end_time=2024-11-28T00:00:00Z&min_duration=60&limit=10&offset=0\n```\n\n*   `content_type=session`: Indicates a session-based search.\n*   `app_name`, `window_name`: Filter by application and window (optional).\n*   `start_time`, `end_time`: Date range for the session (optional, defaults to last 24 hours).\n*   `min_duration`, `max_duration`: Filter by session duration in seconds (optional).\n*   `limit`, `offset`: Pagination parameters.\n\n\nafter discussing with @louis030195 on discord he proposed something like this as the output\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"app_name\": \"Cursor\",\n      \"total_usage_time\": 3600,\n      \"windows\": [\n        {\n          \"window_name\": \"page.tsx\",\n          \"sessions\": [\n            {\n              \"start_time\": \"2024-07-16T12:00:00Z\",\n              \"end_time\": \"2024-07-16T12:30:00Z\",\n              \"duration\": 1800,\n              \"content_ids\": [123, 124, 125],\n              \"tags\": [\"coding\", \"frontend\"]\n            },\n            {\n              \"start_time\": \"2024-07-16T14:00:00Z\",\n              \"end_time\": \"2024-07-16T14:30:00Z\",\n              \"duration\": 1800,\n              \"content_ids\": [223, 224, 225],\n              \"tags\": [\"coding\", \"frontend\"]\n            }\n          ],\n          \"total_usage_time\": 3600\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"app_name\": \"Arc\",\n      \"total_usage_time\": 1200,\n      \"windows\": [\n        {\n          \"window_name\": \"x.com\",\n          \"sessions\": [\n            {\n              \"start_time\": \"2024-07-16T10:30:00Z\",\n              \"end_time\": \"2024-07-16T10:50:00Z\",\n              \"duration\": 1200,\n              \"content_ids\": [126, 127, 128],\n              \"tags\": [\"browsing\", \"social-media\"]\n            }\n          ],\n          \"total_usage_time\": 1200\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"pagination\": {\n    \"limit\": 50,\n    \"offset\": 0,\n    \"total\": 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3.3. Session Boundary Detection Logic\n\n1.  **Real-time Monitoring:**  The existing event listeners for OCR, audio, and UI events will be leveraged.\n\n2.  **Session Tracking:**  Maintain a data structure (likely in memory, possibly augmented with periodic database writes for persistence) to track active sessions.  This structure should map:\n    *   `(app_name, window_name)` -> `(session_id, last_activity_timestamp)`\n\n3.  **New Event Handling:**\n    *   When a new event (OCR, audio, UI) arrives:\n        *   Extract `app_name` and `window_name`.\n        *   Check if an active session exists for this (app, window) combination.\n        *   If a session exists:\n            *   Check if `now() - last_activity_timestamp` exceeds the inactivity timeout.\n            *   If timeout exceeded, end the existing session and create a new one.\n            *   If not timed out, update `last_activity_timestamp` to the event's timestamp.\n        *   If no session exists:\n            *   Create a new session with `start_time` and `end_time` set to the event's timestamp.\n            *   Generate a new `session_id`.\n            *   Insert a new row into the `sessions` table.\n        *   Insert the new data (OCR, audio, UI) into the relevant table, linking it to the active `session_id`.\n\n4.  **Inactivity Timeout:** A configurable timeout (e.g., 5 minutes) will be used to determine session end due to inactivity.\n\n5.  **Periodic Flushing:** To avoid excessive in-memory state, periodically flush closed sessions (those that have exceeded the inactivity timeout) to the database.\n\n6. **Data Migration:** A migration script will be needed to analyze existing data and create initial session records based on timestamp proximity and app/window changes.\n\n### 3.4. Implementation Details\n\n*   **Language/Framework:** Continue using Rust for core logic and database interaction.\n*   **Database:** Continue using SQLite.\n*   **Concurrency:** Use asynchronous operations with `tokio` for handling concurrent events and database interactions.  Leverage `Arc` and `Mutex` for shared state, and channels for communication between tasks.\n*   **Configuration:** Add a new setting for the inactivity timeout.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling with `anyhow` and propagate errors appropriately. Log errors using `tracing`.\n* **Testing:** Thoroughly test session boundary detection with various scenarios, including rapid switching, long inactivity periods, and concurrent events.\n\n## 4.

New API Endpoint (Modified /search)\n\nThe existing `/search` endpoint will be extended to support session-based queries.  No new endpoint is needed.\n\n## 5. Performance Implications\n\n*   **Database:**  The addition of the `sessions` table and foreign keys will add some overhead to write operations.  Proper indexing is crucial to mitigate this.  Read performance for session-based queries should be good with appropriate indexes.\n*   **Memory:**  The in-memory session tracking will require additional memory.  The size of this will depend on the number of concurrent users and the configured timeout.  This should be monitored and potentially optimized (e.g., using a more efficient data structure than a simple `HashMap`).\n*   **CPU:**  The session boundary detection logic will add some CPU overhead.  This should be minimized by efficient checks and the use of asynchronous operations.\n\n## 6. Migration Path\n\n1.  **Add new `sessions` table.**\n2.  **Add `session_id` columns** to `ocr_text`, `audio_transcriptions`, and `ui_monitoring` tables.\n3.  **Backfill `session_id`:**  A migration script will be needed to analyze existing data and create initial session records.  This script will need to:\n    *   Iterate through existing OCR, audio, and UI data in chronological order.\n    *   Apply the session boundary detection logic (described above) to group data into sessions.\n    *   Insert corresponding rows into the `sessions` table.\n    *   Update the `session_id` foreign key in the existing tables.\n\n\n## 7. Alternative Approaches\n\n1.  **Session Table per Content Type:** Instead of a single `sessions` table, we could have separate session tables for each content type (e.g., `ocr_sessions`, `audio_sessions`, `ui_sessions`).  This might simplify queries for a specific content type but could make cross-content type analysis more complex.\n2.  **No Session Table (Denormalized):** We could add `start_time` and `end_time` directly to the existing tables (`ocr_text`, `audio_transcriptions`, `ui_monitoring`). This would avoid the need for joins when querying for sessions, but could lead to data redundancy and potential inconsistencies.\n3.  any other suggestions ????\n",

This is making it so I can't use the integration.\r\n\r\nWe also use Fastmail and have been seeing some oddities with the [cal.com](http://cal.com/) integration. Namely, that participants are receiving multiple calendar invites, which on it's own isn't that big of a deal. However, the Fastmail invites are always in UTC, not in the local time of the cal.com invite.\r\n\r\nThis is creating a lot of confusion with participants, they keep missing our meetings, not realizing one invite is UTC and one in local time. I spoke with the Fastmail team and they relayed the following notes about cal's specific integration.\r\n\r\n1. There is a property (SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT) a CalDAV client can add to the event that would prevent CalDAV servers from sending invitations. It appears cal.com is not setting this property even though they are sending an invitation.\r\n2. The invitation being sent by [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is using a different UID. Basically every event has a UID that uniquely identifies the event. Since [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is sending the invitation of the event with a different UID, if you end up adding this event to your calendar [cal.com](http://cal.com/), it will create a duplicate event in your calendar as well. They need to fix it so that all emails associated with a single event use the same original UID.\r\n3. The event added from [cal.com](http://cal.com/) doesn't have a timezone associated with it. Though it mentions the invitees timezone as \"America/Chicago\" in the notes, the event itself doesn't include a timezone and only specifies the time in UTC. Since the event time is specified in UTC, Fastmail's invitation email will also be sent in UTC.\r\n4. There seems to be no way to stop Cal.com from creating the calendar events at all, and thus no real workaround.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Connect to Fastmail using CalDav integration\r\n2. Create a test booking\r\n3. See issues above.\r\n\r\nAny other relevant information. For example, why do you consider this a bug and what did you expect to happen instead?\r\n1. SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT should be set, so Fastmail knows not to send an invitation. **This is the main one.**\r\n2. UID should be unique per event.\r\n3. Event time should have a timezone associated with it.\r\n4. An option could be added to make calendar event creation optional (nice-to-have, not essential).\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\n\r\nNone other than Fastmail/CalDAV.",

              "body": "I propose integrating a feature in Cal.com that allows users to set default Google Calendar notifications for events booked through the platform. This functionality should enable users to select preferred notification times (e.g., 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour before the event) that automatically apply to all events created via Cal.com bookings. Currently, the absence of such a feature leads to missed appointments since default notifications set in Google Calendar do not apply to these events. Integrating this feature would enhance user experience by ensuring consistency in how notifications are handled, regardless of how an event is booked.\n\n<sub>[CAL-4716](https://linear.app/calcom/issue/CAL-4716/missing-notifications-for-events)</sub>",

This means automated backups are not available for databases in these deployments.\n\nHowever, when using \"Empty Docker Compose\" or one-click services (like Supabase), database detection works correctly and backups are available.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\n| Deployment Method | Model | Creates ServiceDatabase | Backups Available |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Empty Docker Compose | `Service` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |\n| GitHub App (dockercompose buildpack) | `Application` | ❌ No | ❌ No |\n| One-click Services (e.g., Supabase) | `Service` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nDatabase services in Docker Compose files deployed via GitHub App should be detected and have backup functionality available, similar to Empty Docker Compose deployments.\n\n### Technical Details\n\nThe issue is in `bootstrap/helpers/shared.php` in the `parseDockerComposeFile()` function:\n\n**Service model path (lines 1263-2025):**\n- Calls `isDatabaseImage()` to detect databases\n- Creates `ServiceDatabase` records for detected databases\n- These databases can have scheduled backups\n\n**Application model path (lines 2026-2767):**\n- Does NOT call `isDatabaseImage()`\n- Does NOT create `ServiceDatabase` records\n- All services are treated as application containers\n- No backup support\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nAdd database detection logic to the Application model parsing path:\n\n1. In `parseDockerComposeFile()` for the Application model (around line 2066), add:\n   ```php\n   $isDatabase = isDatabaseImage($image, $service);\n   data_set($service, 'is_database', $isDatabase);\n   ```\n\n2. Create `ServiceDatabase` records for detected database services, similar to how it's done in the Service model path.\n\n3. Alternatively, consider refactoring to share the database detection logic between both paths.\n\n### Use Case\n\nUsers deploying full-stack applications via GitHub (e.g., Next.js app + PostgreSQL + pgbouncer in a single compose file) expect database backups to work the same way as standalone database deployments or one-click services.\n\n### Related Code\n\n- `bootstrap/helpers/shared.php` - `parseDockerComposeFile()` function\n- `bootstrap/helpers/docker.php` - `isDatabaseImage()` function\n- `app/Models/ServiceDatabase.php` - Database model with backup support\n- `app/Models/ScheduledDatabaseBackup.php` - Backup scheduling\n\n### Environment\n\n- Coolify version: latest\n- Deployment method: GitHub App with dockercompose buildpack\n",

Ideally, a system in which \"addons\" in these same repositories as the whole \"Services\" themselves can be added on to each individual service; I.e. for Cloudflared, my request above. Or for Supabase, an easy tool to help you visualize the parts missing from Selfhosted that are in Supabase SaaS/Cloud and perhaps an API to interface with it. **This would make Coolify the single self-hosted PaaS with scripting for templates, but also an extension system allowing new functionality.**\n\nIf you are interested in discussing, claiming or collaborating on one of these bounties, see the little repo I made to track this here:\nhttps://github.com/rootacc3ss/coolify-bounties/tree/main",
