To support any size database we should investigate enhancements to allow any sized database to be exported. Currently the size limitations are 1GB for Durable Objects with 10GB in the future. Operate under the assumption that we might be attempting to dump a 10GB database into a `.sql` file.\n\nAnother consideration to make is because Durable Objects execute synchronous operations we may need to allow for \"breathing intervals\". An example might be we allow our export operation to run for 5 seconds, and take 5 seconds off if other requests are in a queue, then it can pick up again. The goal here would be to prevent locking the database for long periods of time.\n\nBut then poses the questions: \n1. How do we continue operations that need more than 30 seconds to work?\n2. Where is the data stored as it's being created? (R2, S3, something else)?\n3. How do we deliver that dump information to the user after its completed?\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Hit the `/export/dump` endpoint on a large database\n2. Will eventually fail when the 30 second request response time window closes\n\nRun the following command in Terminal (replace the URL with yours) and if your operation exceeds 30 seconds you should see a failed network response instead of a dump file.\n```\ncurl --location 'https://starbasedb.YOUR-ID-HERE.workers.dev/export/dump' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' \\\n--output database_dump.sql\n```\n\nIf you can't create a large enough test database feel free to add code in to `sleep` for 29 seconds before proceeding with the `/export/dump` functional code and should also see the failure.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nAs a user I would expect any and all of the specified data to be dumped out without an error and without partial results. Where it ends up for the user to access if the operation takes more than 30 seconds is up for discussion. Ideally if shorter than 30 seconds it could be returned as our cURL above works today (downloads the file from the response of the origin request), but perhaps after the timeout it continues on uploads it to a destination source to access afterwards?\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n1. For backups require an R2 binding\n2. Have a `.sql` file that gets created in R2 with the filename like `dump_20240101-170000.sql` where it represents `2024-01-01 17:00:00`\n3. Create the file and continuously append new chunks to it until reaching the end\n4. May need to utilize a DO alarm to continue the work after X time if a timeout occurs & mark where it currently is in the process in internal memory so it can pick up and continue.\n5. Provide a callback URL when the operation is finally completed so users can create custom logic to notify them (e.g. Email, Slack, etc)",

There is no configuration to turn this on or off with ease, or even commented out docker-compose, nor any notes.\n2. With how we expose Kong via URL by default, the approach in the document could be messy or unsafe\n3. It looks like additional configuration may be required if there are multiple Supabase instances on the same server with individual /mcp exposures as Traefik is handling the routing and everything is using the same ports, etc...\n\n**I am looking for a \"work around\" as the resolution for this bounty.** That is acceptable, but I will require **at minimum a tutorial below** that figures out how to get around this bug/issue and properly documents the following:\n\n- How to configure the MCP and use it on local network\n- How to setup Wireguard to properly allow for usage of this MCP\n- How to configure Cursor/Claude Code/Windsurf to use this MCP\n- **MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOW TO CONNECT TO DIFFERENT SUPABASE INSTANCES ON THE SAME COOLIFY INSTANCE (assuming all of them are running the default Service template)**\n\nCreating a fix within the system we have to spin up and manage a Supabase instance may be difficult due to the template system's restraints, but if you want to work on that complaint of mine and **earn much more than $15**, you can see the bottom of this post. I list off the other bounties I will be offering and putting up cash for upon clearing some wires and hopefully seeing someone (or a few people) dedicate time to it.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Follow docs linked above\n2.

There is no configuration to turn this on or off with ease, or even commented out docker-compose, nor any notes.\n2. With how we expose Kong via URL by default, the approach in the document could be messy or unsafe\n3. It looks like additional configuration may be required if there are multiple Supabase instances on the same server with individual /mcp exposures as Traefik is handling the routing and everything is using the same ports, etc...\n\n**I am looking for a \"work around\" as the resolution for this bounty.** That is acceptable, but I will require **at minimum a tutorial below** that figures out how to get around this bug/issue and properly documents the following:\n\n- How to configure the MCP and use it on local network\n- How to setup Wireguard to properly allow for usage of this MCP\n- How to configure Cursor/Claude Code/Windsurf to use this MCP\n- **MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOW TO CONNECT TO DIFFERENT SUPABASE INSTANCES ON THE SAME COOLIFY INSTANCE (assuming all of them are running the default Service template)**\n\nCreating a fix within the system we have to spin up and manage a Supabase instance may be difficult due to the template system's restraints, but if you want to work on that complaint of mine and **earn much more than $15**, you can see the bottom of this post. I list off the other bounties I will be offering and putting up cash for upon clearing some wires and hopefully seeing someone (or a few people) dedicate time to it.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1.

Just a filebrowser for everything that you can see inside the container itself. \n\nPrio 1: mapped folders\nPrio 2: everything \"inside\" the container. \n\nIt should support: \n\n- Browsing like windows explorer or nautilus under linux\n- Upload and download single files\n- Upload and download folders\n- Create folders\n- Delete folders / files\n- Check Filesize\n- Check permissions (optional: set them)\n",

This is making it so I can't use the integration.\r\n\r\nWe also use Fastmail and have been seeing some oddities with the [cal.com](http://cal.com/) integration. Namely, that participants are receiving multiple calendar invites, which on it's own isn't that big of a deal. However, the Fastmail invites are always in UTC, not in the local time of the cal.com invite.\r\n\r\nThis is creating a lot of confusion with participants, they keep missing our meetings, not realizing one invite is UTC and one in local time. I spoke with the Fastmail team and they relayed the following notes about cal's specific integration.\r\n\r\n1. There is a property (SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT) a CalDAV client can add to the event that would prevent CalDAV servers from sending invitations. It appears cal.com is not setting this property even though they are sending an invitation.\r\n2. The invitation being sent by [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is using a different UID. Basically every event has a UID that uniquely identifies the event. Since [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is sending the invitation of the event with a different UID, if you end up adding this event to your calendar [cal.com](http://cal.com/), it will create a duplicate event in your calendar as well. They need to fix it so that all emails associated with a single event use the same original UID.\r\n3. The event added from [cal.com](http://cal.com/) doesn't have a timezone associated with it. Though it mentions the invitees timezone as \"America/Chicago\" in the notes, the event itself doesn't include a timezone and only specifies the time in UTC. Since the event time is specified in UTC, Fastmail's invitation email will also be sent in UTC.\r\n4. There seems to be no way to stop Cal.com from creating the calendar events at all, and thus no real workaround.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Connect to Fastmail using CalDav integration\r\n2. Create a test booking\r\n3. See issues above.\r\n\r\nAny other relevant information. For example, why do you consider this a bug and what did you expect to happen instead?\r\n1. SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT should be set, so Fastmail knows not to send an invitation. **This is the main one.**\r\n2. UID should be unique per event.\r\n3. Event time should have a timezone associated with it.\r\n4. An option could be added to make calendar event creation optional (nice-to-have, not essential).\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\n\r\nNone other than Fastmail/CalDAV.",

When I try to add Pipedrive via the web UI, I receive an error message stating \"pipedrive client id missing.\"\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI would like the Pipedrive integration to be updated to remove the dependency on Revert.dev. Instead, the integration should directly use Pipedrive's API, implementing OAuth2 authentication. This would involve updating the web UI to allow users to input their Pipedrive Client ID and Client Secret to establish the connection.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI've considered manually integrating Pipedrive using custom API scripts, but this approach is not practical for most users due to its complexity. I also looked into third-party integration tools, but they may not offer the same seamless experience and could incur additional costs.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nMaintaining a functional Pipedrive integration is crucial for users who rely on it to sync their scheduling with their CRM systems. The deprecation of Revert.dev has disrupted this workflow, impacting productivity. Updating the integration will restore this essential functionality for many users.\r\n\r\n### Requirement/Document\r\n\r\n- [Pipedrive API Authentication Documentation](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/core-api-concepts-authentication)\r\n",
