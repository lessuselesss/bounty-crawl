Review the current implementation before making changes, and ensure that all new features follow existing coding patterns and standards.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 Triggers  \n\n| **Trigger** | **Use Case** |\n|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------|\n| **New Starred Email** | Fires when an email is starred (within 2 days).|\n| **New Conversation** | Fires when a new conversation (thread) begins.|\n|**New Attachment**|Fires when an email with an attachment arrives (with optional filters).|\n|**New Label**|Triggers when a new label is created.|\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Write Actions  \n\n| **Action Item**               | **Use Case** |\n|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------|\n| **Reply to Email** | Reply within an existing thread, maintaining context. |\n| **Create Draft Reply** | Generate a reply draft within an existing thread.|\n| **Add Label to Email** | Attach a label to an individual email.|\n|**Remove Label from Email**|Remove a specific label from an email.Remove a specific label from an email.|\n|**Create Label**|Create a new user label in Gmail.|\n|**Archive Email**|Archive (move to “All Mail”) rather than deleting.|\n|**Delete Email**|Permanently move an email to Trash.|\n|**Remove Label from Thread**|Strip a label from all emails in a thread.|\n---\n\n## 🔍 Search Actions  \n\n| **Action Item**               | **Use Case**                                                                                                                                     |\n|:------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Find Email** | Locate a specific email using search keywords like subject, sender, or content.|\n\n---\n\n\n## 📚 API Reference  \n- [Official Gmail API Documentation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/guides)\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Test Account Access  \nYou can test Gmail APIs using a Google account with enabled Gmail API in a [Google Cloud Project Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n\n---\n\n## 🧑‍💻 New to Activepieces?\n\nActivepieces is the leading open source AI automation platform. We have many apps (we call them Pieces), that are available within the builder and as MCPs. These apps are built with our TypeScript framework and are easy to develop. Once merged into our repository, they become available as pieces in our automation builder and as MCPs usable by AI agents and MCP clients.\n\nStart building here: [Piece Development Docs](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/developers/building-pieces/overview)\n",
