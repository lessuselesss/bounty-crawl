Since `go-tree-sitter` relies on CGO, cross-platform compilation (especially for darwin/arm64) becomes complicated.  \n\nI have a few questions:  \n1. Is `go-tree-sitter` strictly required for Katana, or only for certain features?  \n2. Are there any alternative pure-Go libraries we could use instead of `go-tree-sitter` to simplify cross-platform builds?  \n\nThis would help in making snapshot builds and CI/CD pipelines simpler, without needing to configure CGO or cross-compilers.  \n\nThanks!\n\n---\n\n### Use Case\n\n- Simplifying cross-platform builds (Windows → macOS/ARM)  \n- Avoiding CGO-related compilation issues  \n- Maintaining full functionality while reducing dependency complexity",

Since `go-tree-sitter` relies on CGO, cross-platform compilation (especially for darwin/arm64) becomes complicated.  \n\nI have a few questions:  \n1.
