For example during my [boat project](https://discuss.px4.io/t/rc-speed-boat-with-px4-episode-1-using-px4-to-control-the-boat/28429#things-that-are-still-ambiguous-to-me-22) build, I wasn't sure if I needed to set the priority of magnetometer manually or not.\r\n\r\nThis is also quite related to the calibration pain addressed in the issue #19459. What can we do to improve user experience for setting up the sensors? If so, which part should be addressed and how?\r\n\r\nWhat could be great (in my opinion) could be something like this in QGC (it won't be a literal text output like this, but just for giving some idea):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # First mag sensor\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # One for the second mag\r\n<baro-type> |              | <baro-priority> | <baro-protocol>\r\n<gyro-type> | <gyro-orientation> | <gyro-priority> | <gyro-protocol>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I am also not sure what others expectation / needs are, so any feedback would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n## Describe your preferred solution\r\n* @davids5 pointed out that transferring device tree information over to QGC could be a solution. Could you elaborate on that?\r\n* @dagar pointed out that having a unified view in general would be good. Could you let me know if a view I suggested above is similar to what you have imagined?\r\n",

For example during my [boat project](https://discuss.px4.io/t/rc-speed-boat-with-px4-episode-1-using-px4-to-control-the-boat/28429#things-that-are-still-ambiguous-to-me-22) build, I wasn't sure if I needed to set the priority of magnetometer manually or not.\r\n\r\nThis is also quite related to the calibration pain addressed in the issue #19459. What can we do to improve user experience for setting up the sensors? If so, which part should be addressed and how?\r\n\r\nWhat could be great (in my opinion) could be something like this in QGC (it won't be a literal text output like this, but just for giving some idea):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # First mag sensor\r\n<mag-type> | <mag-orientation> | <mag-priority> | <mag-protocol?> # One for the second mag\r\n<baro-type> |              | <baro-priority> | <baro-protocol>\r\n<gyro-type> | <gyro-orientation> | <gyro-priority> | <gyro-protocol>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I am also not sure what others expectation / needs are, so any feedback would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n## Describe your preferred solution\r\n* @davids5 pointed out that transferring device tree information over to QGC could be a solution. Could you elaborate on that?\r\n* @dagar pointed out that having a unified view in general would be good. Could you let me know if a view I suggested above is similar to what you have imagined?\r\n",

                  "body": "\n## Challenge\n\nI'm working on an application that requires accurate session tracking to analyze user behavior patterns,  and provide meaningful insights across different applications and windows. \n\nIn the existing Screenpipe architecture, OCR data is stored with only timestamp information, lacking precise session boundaries (start/end times) for application usage tracking. This limitation prevents us from properly segmenting user activity into coherent sessions.\n\n## 1. Current Workaround\ninternally I implementing a suboptimal solution that:\n1. Queries all OCR database entries chronologically\n2. Manually identifies session boundaries by analyzing timestamp sequences for each application\n3. Determines session end when detecting a different application in subsequent timestamps\n4. Assumes a session is ongoing if no clear delimiter exists in future timestamps\n\nWith that said I would love to hear any feedbacks that could help solve this problem with a minimal overhead on code changes, and make sure I'm not overthinking the solution: cc @louis030195 , i'm planning to start playing with some day next week\n\n## 2. Requirements\n\n1.  **Session Definition:** A \"session\" should be defined as a continuous period of user interaction with a specific application and window.  A break in activity (e.g., switching to a different application or window) should end the current session and potentially start a new one.  A configurable inactivity timeout (e.g., 5 minutes) should also end a session.\n\n2.  **Data Storage:** The database schema must be modified to store session start and end times, associated with specific applications and windows.  It must maintain links to the relevant OCR and audio data chunks.\n\n3.  **API Endpoint:**  A new or modified API endpoint (e.g., `/sessions`) is needed to query for session data.  This endpoint should support filtering by:\n    *   Date range (start and end timestamps).\n    *   Application name.\n    *   Window name.\n    *   Minimum and maximum session duration.\n    *   Associated tags.\n    *   Pagination (limit and offset).\n\n4.  **Real-time Capability:** The system should be able to detect session boundaries in near real-time as data is being ingested. This implies integration with the existing data capture and processing pipeline.\n\n5. **Configurability:** The inactivity timeout for ending a session should be configurable.\n\n## 3. Proposed Solution\n\n### 3.1. Database Schema Changes\n\nWe'll introduce a new table `sessions` and modify the existing tables.\n\n**New Table: `sessions`**\n\n| Column Name      | Data Type  | Constraints                                  | Description                                                                  |\n| :--------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `id`             | INTEGER    | PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT                    | Unique identifier for the session.                                       |\n| `app_name`       | TEXT       | NOT NULL                                     | Name of the application.                                                 |\n| `window_name`    | TEXT       |                                               | Title of the window.                                                     |\n| `start_time`     | DATETIME   | NOT NULL                                     | Timestamp of the session start.                                            |\n| `end_time`       | DATETIME   | NOT NULL                                     | Timestamp of the session end.                                              |\n| `duration_secs`  | REAL       | NOT NULL                                     | Duration of the session in seconds.                                        |\n\n**Modified Tables:**\n\n*   **`ocr_text`**: Add a `session_id` column (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY referencing `sessions.id`).\n*   **`audio_transcriptions`**: Add a `session_id` column (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY referencing `sessions.id`).\n*   **`ui_monitoring`**: Add a `session_id` column (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY referencing `sessions.id`).\n\n**Indexes:**\n\n*   Create indexes on `sessions` table columns (`app_name`, `window_name`, `start_time`, `end_time`) for efficient querying.\n*   Create indexes on the `session_id` columns in `ocr_text`, `audio_transcriptions`, and `ui_monitoring`.\n\n### 3.2. API Enhancements\n\nWe'll modify the existing `/search` endpoint to also support session queries.\n\n**Request:**\n\n```\nGET /search?content_type=session&app_name=Cursor&start_time=2024-11-27T00:00:00Z&end_time=2024-11-28T00:00:00Z&min_duration=60&limit=10&offset=0\n```\n\n*   `content_type=session`: Indicates a session-based search.\n*   `app_name`, `window_name`: Filter by application and window (optional).\n*   `start_time`, `end_time`: Date range for the session (optional, defaults to last 24 hours).\n*   `min_duration`, `max_duration`: Filter by session duration in seconds (optional).\n*   `limit`, `offset`: Pagination parameters.\n\n\nafter discussing with @louis030195 on discord he proposed something like this as the output\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"app_name\": \"Cursor\",\n      \"total_usage_time\": 3600,\n      \"windows\": [\n        {\n          \"window_name\": \"page.tsx\",\n          \"sessions\": [\n            {\n              \"start_time\": \"2024-07-16T12:00:00Z\",\n              \"end_time\": \"2024-07-16T12:30:00Z\",\n              \"duration\": 1800,\n              \"content_ids\": [123, 124, 125],\n              \"tags\": [\"coding\", \"frontend\"]\n            },\n            {\n              \"start_time\": \"2024-07-16T14:00:00Z\",\n              \"end_time\": \"2024-07-16T14:30:00Z\",\n              \"duration\": 1800,\n              \"content_ids\": [223, 224, 225],\n              \"tags\": [\"coding\", \"frontend\"]\n            }\n          ],\n          \"total_usage_time\": 3600\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"app_name\": \"Arc\",\n      \"total_usage_time\": 1200,\n      \"windows\": [\n        {\n          \"window_name\": \"x.com\",\n          \"sessions\": [\n            {\n              \"start_time\": \"2024-07-16T10:30:00Z\",\n              \"end_time\": \"2024-07-16T10:50:00Z\",\n              \"duration\": 1200,\n              \"content_ids\": [126, 127, 128],\n              \"tags\": [\"browsing\", \"social-media\"]\n            }\n          ],\n          \"total_usage_time\": 1200\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"pagination\": {\n    \"limit\": 50,\n    \"offset\": 0,\n    \"total\": 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3.3. Session Boundary Detection Logic\n\n1.  **Real-time Monitoring:**  The existing event listeners for OCR, audio, and UI events will be leveraged.\n\n2.  **Session Tracking:**  Maintain a data structure (likely in memory, possibly augmented with periodic database writes for persistence) to track active sessions.  This structure should map:\n    *   `(app_name, window_name)` -> `(session_id, last_activity_timestamp)`\n\n3.  **New Event Handling:**\n    *   When a new event (OCR, audio, UI) arrives:\n        *   Extract `app_name` and `window_name`.\n        *   Check if an active session exists for this (app, window) combination.\n        *   If a session exists:\n            *   Check if `now() - last_activity_timestamp` exceeds the inactivity timeout.\n            *   If timeout exceeded, end the existing session and create a new one.\n            *   If not timed out, update `last_activity_timestamp` to the event's timestamp.\n        *   If no session exists:\n            *   Create a new session with `start_time` and `end_time` set to the event's timestamp.\n            *   Generate a new `session_id`.\n            *   Insert a new row into the `sessions` table.\n        *   Insert the new data (OCR, audio, UI) into the relevant table, linking it to the active `session_id`.\n\n4.  **Inactivity Timeout:** A configurable timeout (e.g., 5 minutes) will be used to determine session end due to inactivity.\n\n5.  **Periodic Flushing:** To avoid excessive in-memory state, periodically flush closed sessions (those that have exceeded the inactivity timeout) to the database.\n\n6. **Data Migration:** A migration script will be needed to analyze existing data and create initial session records based on timestamp proximity and app/window changes.\n\n### 3.4. Implementation Details\n\n*   **Language/Framework:** Continue using Rust for core logic and database interaction.\n*   **Database:** Continue using SQLite.\n*   **Concurrency:** Use asynchronous operations with `tokio` for handling concurrent events and database interactions.  Leverage `Arc` and `Mutex` for shared state, and channels for communication between tasks.\n*   **Configuration:** Add a new setting for the inactivity timeout.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling with `anyhow` and propagate errors appropriately. Log errors using `tracing`.\n* **Testing:** Thoroughly test session boundary detection with various scenarios, including rapid switching, long inactivity periods, and concurrent events.\n\n## 4.

This limitation prevents us from properly segmenting user activity into coherent sessions.\n\n## 1. Current Workaround\ninternally I implementing a suboptimal solution that:\n1. Queries all OCR database entries chronologically\n2. Manually identifies session boundaries by analyzing timestamp sequences for each application\n3. Determines session end when detecting a different application in subsequent timestamps\n4. Assumes a session is ongoing if no clear delimiter exists in future timestamps\n\nWith that said I would love to hear any feedbacks that could help solve this problem with a minimal overhead on code changes, and make sure I'm not overthinking the solution: cc @louis030195 , i'm planning to start playing with some day next week\n\n## 2. Requirements\n\n1.  **Session Definition:** A \"session\" should be defined as a continuous period of user interaction with a specific application and window.  A break in activity (e.g., switching to a different application or window) should end the current session and potentially start a new one.  A configurable inactivity timeout (e.g., 5 minutes) should also end a session.\n\n2.  **Data Storage:** The database schema must be modified to store session start and end times, associated with specific applications and windows.  It must maintain links to the relevant OCR and audio data chunks.\n\n3.  **API Endpoint:**  A new or modified API endpoint (e.g., `/sessions`) is needed to query for session data.  This endpoint should support filtering by:\n    *   Date range (start and end timestamps).\n    *   Application name.\n    *   Window name.\n    *   Minimum and maximum session duration.\n    *   Associated tags.\n    *   Pagination (limit and offset).\n\n4.  **Real-time Capability:** The system should be able to detect session boundaries in near real-time as data is being ingested. This implies integration with the existing data capture and processing pipeline.\n\n5. **Configurability:** The inactivity timeout for ending a session should be configurable.\n\n## 3. Proposed Solution\n\n### 3.1. Database Schema Changes\n\nWe'll introduce a new table `sessions` and modify the existing tables.\n\n**New Table: `sessions`**\n\n| Column Name      | Data Type  | Constraints                                  | Description                                                                  |\n| :--------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `id`             | INTEGER    | PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT                    | Unique identifier for the session.                                       |\n| `app_name`       | TEXT       | NOT NULL                                     | Name of the application.                                                 |\n| `window_name`    | TEXT       |                                               | Title of the window.                                                     |\n| `start_time`     | DATETIME   | NOT NULL                                     | Timestamp of the session start.                                            |\n| `end_time`       | DATETIME   | NOT NULL                                     | Timestamp of the session end.                                              |\n| `duration_secs`  | REAL       | NOT NULL                                     | Duration of the session in seconds.                                        |\n\n**Modified Tables:**\n\n*   **`ocr_text`**: Add a `session_id` column (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY referencing `sessions.id`).\n*   **`audio_transcriptions`**: Add a `session_id` column (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY referencing `sessions.id`).\n*   **`ui_monitoring`**: Add a `session_id` column (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY referencing `sessions.id`).\n\n**Indexes:**\n\n*   Create indexes on `sessions` table columns (`app_name`, `window_name`, `start_time`, `end_time`) for efficient querying.\n*   Create indexes on the `session_id` columns in `ocr_text`, `audio_transcriptions`, and `ui_monitoring`.\n\n### 3.2. API Enhancements\n\nWe'll modify the existing `/search` endpoint to also support session queries.\n\n**Request:**\n\n```\nGET /search?content_type=session&app_name=Cursor&start_time=2024-11-27T00:00:00Z&end_time=2024-11-28T00:00:00Z&min_duration=60&limit=10&offset=0\n```\n\n*   `content_type=session`: Indicates a session-based search.\n*   `app_name`, `window_name`: Filter by application and window (optional).\n*   `start_time`, `end_time`: Date range for the session (optional, defaults to last 24 hours).\n*   `min_duration`, `max_duration`: Filter by session duration in seconds (optional).\n*   `limit`, `offset`: Pagination parameters.\n\n\nafter discussing with @louis030195 on discord he proposed something like this as the output\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"app_name\": \"Cursor\",\n      \"total_usage_time\": 3600,\n      \"windows\": [\n        {\n          \"window_name\": \"page.tsx\",\n          \"sessions\": [\n            {\n              \"start_time\": \"2024-07-16T12:00:00Z\",\n              \"end_time\": \"2024-07-16T12:30:00Z\",\n              \"duration\": 1800,\n              \"content_ids\": [123, 124, 125],\n              \"tags\": [\"coding\", \"frontend\"]\n            },\n            {\n              \"start_time\": \"2024-07-16T14:00:00Z\",\n              \"end_time\": \"2024-07-16T14:30:00Z\",\n              \"duration\": 1800,\n              \"content_ids\": [223, 224, 225],\n              \"tags\": [\"coding\", \"frontend\"]\n            }\n          ],\n          \"total_usage_time\": 3600\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"app_name\": \"Arc\",\n      \"total_usage_time\": 1200,\n      \"windows\": [\n        {\n          \"window_name\": \"x.com\",\n          \"sessions\": [\n            {\n              \"start_time\": \"2024-07-16T10:30:00Z\",\n              \"end_time\": \"2024-07-16T10:50:00Z\",\n              \"duration\": 1200,\n              \"content_ids\": [126, 127, 128],\n              \"tags\": [\"browsing\", \"social-media\"]\n            }\n          ],\n          \"total_usage_time\": 1200\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"pagination\": {\n    \"limit\": 50,\n    \"offset\": 0,\n    \"total\": 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3.3. Session Boundary Detection Logic\n\n1.  **Real-time Monitoring:**  The existing event listeners for OCR, audio, and UI events will be leveraged.\n\n2.  **Session Tracking:**  Maintain a data structure (likely in memory, possibly augmented with periodic database writes for persistence) to track active sessions.  This structure should map:\n    *   `(app_name, window_name)` -> `(session_id, last_activity_timestamp)`\n\n3.  **New Event Handling:**\n    *   When a new event (OCR, audio, UI) arrives:\n        *   Extract `app_name` and `window_name`.\n        *   Check if an active session exists for this (app, window) combination.\n        *   If a session exists:\n            *   Check if `now() - last_activity_timestamp` exceeds the inactivity timeout.\n            *   If timeout exceeded, end the existing session and create a new one.\n            *   If not timed out, update `last_activity_timestamp` to the event's timestamp.\n        *   If no session exists:\n            *   Create a new session with `start_time` and `end_time` set to the event's timestamp.\n            *   Generate a new `session_id`.\n            *   Insert a new row into the `sessions` table.\n        *   Insert the new data (OCR, audio, UI) into the relevant table, linking it to the active `session_id`.\n\n4.  **Inactivity Timeout:** A configurable timeout (e.g., 5 minutes) will be used to determine session end due to inactivity.\n\n5.  **Periodic Flushing:** To avoid excessive in-memory state, periodically flush closed sessions (those that have exceeded the inactivity timeout) to the database.\n\n6. **Data Migration:** A migration script will be needed to analyze existing data and create initial session records based on timestamp proximity and app/window changes.\n\n### 3.4. Implementation Details\n\n*   **Language/Framework:** Continue using Rust for core logic and database interaction.\n*   **Database:** Continue using SQLite.\n*   **Concurrency:** Use asynchronous operations with `tokio` for handling concurrent events and database interactions.  Leverage `Arc` and `Mutex` for shared state, and channels for communication between tasks.\n*   **Configuration:** Add a new setting for the inactivity timeout.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling with `anyhow` and propagate errors appropriately. Log errors using `tracing`.\n* **Testing:** Thoroughly test session boundary detection with various scenarios, including rapid switching, long inactivity periods, and concurrent events.\n\n## 4.
